I'm Francis Murillo and I am a mediocre developer.

For me, there are no ninjas or rockstar developers; only people who code or not. It is a life worth giving as is with science or art.

I would describe myself more of an artist. I love the design of languages, the styles of painting abstract lines in a screen, the brush strokes of thought and code. Creative thoughts and engaging work is what motivates me.

Coding is not work, it is life.
