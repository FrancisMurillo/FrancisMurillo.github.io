I have just attended the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/729492017153864/?acontext=%7B%22ref%22:4,%22feed_story_type%22:370,%22action_history%22:%22null%22%7D">first Philippine Emacs User Group meeting</a>. I am quite
excited to be there although there were only six people there. You
always start small. I pray I would be able to show some crazy hacks for
Emacs just to show it is awesome. So what a good time to talk about my experience in
hacking with Emacs.
</p>

<p>
This is what I recently hacked on Emacs.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
A configurable init file that allows me to change the Emacs home
directory with -H command line switch
</p>

<p>
This allows me to load other configuration files without
affecting my own. I always wanted to checkout <a href="https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs">Spacemacs</a> but I don't
want to rename files or run custom aliases. What I wanted was a master
configuration and opening custom configurations independent of each
other. Aside from Spacemacs, I wanted to study some of the master's
configuration along with my own.
</p></li>

<li><p>
A <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile">projectile</a> project initialization script
</p>

<p>
When I'm doing this blog, I always run a <code>project.el</code> script to setup my
functions to publish the files. Not that mind blowing but I'm starting
to feel confident on using lisp now, well not all of it. For now...
</p></li>

<li><p>
Reorganizing my configuration file
</p>

<p>
After the first versions of using an org file for my configuration, I
finally organized the package declarations in such a nice way. The
<a href="https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package">use-package</a> macro is such a great way of organizing imports but
organizing how they are organized is always a job of a human.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
So forth and so on but what I really wanted to say is that it was fun
doing it. The joy of hacking Emacs. Each line I change to my configuration,
is an investment, is a bonding moment, is knowing more. I feel there is
so much more to do which excites my curiosity and excitement even
further. I wait for the day when I know almost all facets of Emacs.
</p>

<p>
So here lies why I don't use a starter kit or a custom configuration, my
configuration is what my relationship with Emacs is. If it is not mine,
it is not personal. I do not know who it is, it is a stranger
altogether; it is not the friend that I grew up in triumph and
frustration.
</p>

<p>
Spacemacs is very sleek and pretty but it is not mine. It is nice to
know what makes it different and then assimilate the it with my own but
again I don't know everything about it. It is like hiding a secret from
a trusted confidant. And when something is wrong with it, it is not my
responsibility. Ownership, when something is I am responsible for fixing
it. In there I find my meaning, empowering in taking lead.
</p>

<p>
Or I am just a control freak who wants to know everything happening at
my level. I can probably expound more but I find it nice to know how
seriously I take my relationship with Emacs is. When I was using an IDE,
it was just being impressed with features and the productivity but
nothing more as an tool; working with Emacs is such a different
experience altogether.
</p>

<p>
If that is somehow true for other Emacs users, looking at how much they
hacked on Emacs is like knowing their story. The configuration
story. What a nice thought to have there and I like it. A story in
code. Who is doesn't like a story? As time goes by I may continually
fascinated the story I write with it.
</p>

<p>
Here I might get a little religious. The way I describe it, it feels
like I am talking about God. Who in his eternal mystery and power, come
to share a personal relationship or story. How I came to believe, how I
am continually curious about the mysteries of faith, how I find purpose
in living. Or I am just entirely wrong and paranoid, I just want to say
hacking with Emacs is such a joy that might consume me until the final
bit. What a nice thought.
