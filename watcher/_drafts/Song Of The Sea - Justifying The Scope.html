<i><b>Song of the Sea uses mirroring to justify the scope of the film.</b></i>
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_of_the_Sea_%282014_film%29">Song of the Sea (2014)</a> is one the best hand drawn film I have ever
seen that belongs on the list of the greatest. Like with Shinkai
films, every frame in the movie can be considered a wallpaper and it
holds up to this day. I rarely notice or comment on the music but it
feels so mystical and unique that it pales in comparison with the
standard music affair of sounding the same, avoiding copyright and so
on. I could probably sing praises all day but I am here to talk about
why Saoirse song matters.
</p>

<p>
<b>SPOILER ALERT</b>
</p>

<p>
The story is about a boy accepting the loss of her mother and saving
her sister so why did her song save the whole of the spirit world? At
the face, all her song needed to do is cure her and implicitly call
her mother to turn her into a human. Was there really a need to free
the spirits? Let us think about the meaning film and see where it
takes us.
</p>

<p>
My reasoning is within the film itself, I am not an expert in myth so
I can only go so far. Just a reminder.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf552d11" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf552d11">Saoirse's Song</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf552d11">
<p>
In answering why her song was global in saving the world, let's
consider its meaning. According to the film with an early scene by Ben
which I found at the <a href="http://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/movie_script.php?movie=song-of-the-sea">script</a>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">BEN: She's singing her song so that she can send all the fairies home
across the sea.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
There is also a reminder of this with the musical Deenashee after they
sing the nice jig or song:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">DEENASHEE: Human child, find the selkie's true coat, then she can sing
the song and save us all.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The scene with the Great Senachai also hints at this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">GREAT SENACHIA: She'll be turned to stone soon, no doubt. You see,
without her coat, the selkie has no voice. And without her song, she'll
not last the night. And we'll all share in her fate.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So with these three dialogue is it still not foreshadowed correctly? I
think it is still not that well foreshadowed since it is not shown or
elaborated that the song would carry such scope. The word you might
use here is "hinted", a good way for the song's scope be established
is that Bronach sings and shows the spirit being led home.
</p>

<p>
However, does it matter so much whether her song saves all or just
herself. At face value, it ties everyone to a resolved ending. Also
her singing is known to be magical, her stifled singing through the
shell's voice was enough to break Macha's magic. Once she had a real
voice, the world listened. So despite being only hinted, it shouldn't
be a problem in terms of mechanics?
</p>

<p>
I think the problem most people have is that it seems like it did come
out of nowhere. From a casual viewing, it might be that way. Only
thinking about it would you really understand and appreciate the use
of symbols and parallels. By exploring at the tricks it employs, her
song might really have more to it than just a pretty and cute voice.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdff0a3c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgdff0a3c">Bronach's Song</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdff0a3c">
<p>
If I called Bronach singing would be a foreshadowing, why didn't she
sing before Saoirse and Ben were born before dying in childbirth? To
reason out for her, it might be as simple as she can't not that she
won't. Before she died, did she lose her magic? We have no direct
evidence of this but it is established that the story of Mac Lir and
Macha is known means that she wasn't able to use her magic to free Mac
Lir prior to the legends Also it is quite a question whether being
with the father stripped her of her powers as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponyo">Ponyo</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid">The Little
Mermaid</a>. She might also have used last her of powers simply to give
birth to her Selkie daughter.
</p>

<p>
Bottom line, she can't and the story has no need to delve into this
aspect of her magic. It does setup or leave it to her daughter to
carry out her lost duty whatever the prior reason might have been.
</p>

<p>
One of the symbolic moments for Bronach's legacy is where Ben teaches
Saoirse the song his mother taught her but not her sister. If she did
not teach this song, would there be a song to activate her coat and
save her in the first place? It is also quite curious that Saoirse
does not know the song being six years old meaning Ben is withdrawing
the love and legacy of her mother which really adds more to what she
sings.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">BRONACH: My son. Remember me, in your stories and in your songs. Know
that I will always love you. Always.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
That beautiful dialogue holds a lot of meaning but for now it
emphasizes Ben forgiving Saoirse by giving her the song. In doing so,
she carries the legacy of her mother meaning that there father can now
be awaken by the fact her wife's love carries on there child as
indicated by this dialogue:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">CONOR: Bronach. I loved you so much. I still do.

CONOR: It's as though I've been asleep, all these years. I'm so sorry.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The choice of Saoirse staying is also monumental, by staying she
acknowledges and forgives Ben thus completing his arc and their
father. The problem of the family has been resolved by the passing of
this song and thus saving their family which is the equivalent of
saving their own little world.
</p>

<p>
But again this does not answer why the song is that global, all that
is needed for this song is to call there mother from the other side
and give Saoirse the choice of staying. So where does the resolution
of spirit world fit in here?

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc889897">
<p>
One of the tricks this anime uses is mirroring the characters. What I
want you to consider is how they are similar in design and story. It
is akin to having a human and spiritual counterpart.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><b>Granny and Macha</b></dt><dd>Mothers who want to comfort there mourning sons</dd>
<dt><b>Conor and Mac Lir</b></dt><dd>Sons who have lost there wives</dd>
<dt><b>Ferryman Dan and Great Senachia</b></dt><dd>Guides to there respective world</dd>
<dt><b>Saoirse and Bronach</b></dt><dd>Bridges to there world</dd>
<dt><b>Cu and Mac Lir Dogs</b></dt><dd>Dogs</dd>
</dl>

<p>
There are more similarities such as there voice actors which is
probably not an oversight but these are the core ones. So what does
having mirrors in there respective world actually do? They actually
make the spirit and physical world intertwined or interchangeable.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">BRONACH: All of my kind must leave tonight. But, Saoirse, you are part
human. If I take her coat, our worlds will be untangled.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Untangled. That fact that there is no magical portal that takes the
protagonist to a new world emphasizes this. Each of the places where
the story proceeds is within one world, be it a sewer or a forest or
there home. This is enhanced by the fact that the people that Ben know
are also the same people in the other world. If the parallels are
correct, helping the spirit world means helping the physical world.
The solution lies in the other side.
</p>

<p>
This is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_%281939_film%29">Wizard of Oz (1939)</a> where Dorothy wakes up and finds the
people he knew on the dream world in the real world. There parallels
did not exist before but after the story making it just a happy
coincidence, where as in this film it pushes the idea that there is no
separation between the worlds. But in this film this is symbolic
again, how does the song fit in saving the spirits?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgfef040d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgfef040d">Family Story</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfef040d">
<p>
So if you took out the part where the spirits are returning home and
just have Saoirse sing for five minutes, you would have a blank scene
without meaning. (If you think about it, it really might just be
meaningful filler to tie everything nicely.) As I mentioned above the
Selkie is supposed to lead the spirit back home so a montage of
spirits isn't really far off. What I want to posit is that by
mirroring the physical and mystical world, the feelings of Ben with
Saoirse is translated to the world.
</p>

<p>
According to the Senachai, if Ben fails to complete his journey, the
spirits may fall into a stony fate. If what he says is true, it means
there might not be any magic that can counter Macha or that there are
no other Selkie that are alive except Saoirse to do so. I am assuming
that she is the only living Selkie around. So the world is at stake.
</p>

<p>
The journey of Ben is the hero story, traveling to the underworld and
coming to grips with his maternal grief. Would simply getting Saoirse
the coat be the only objective without bonding with her? The three
spirits that Ben meet emphasize how important the song is to saving
the spirits, saving her and forgiving her. If any skimped out, would
Ben understand and tell her the song? Without those, would Saoirse
stay given the choice? By the meaning of her choice, she wouldn't stay
and deny Ben the forgiveness and freedom he deserves. Forgetting about
the journey, is the spirit world still saved regardless? You might say
they are just as long she sings.
</p>

<p>
I believe that Saoirse wouldn't sing even if he told her without
actually forgiving her but it is indeed only my belief of the symbolic
meaning of the act not the logistic of it. So am I saying the family
problem is within the family? Yes and no. It is indeed just a family
problem but by mirroring the character and the world, everyone else is
tied to it.
</p>

<h2 id="orgd04d230">World Story</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd04d230">
<p>
When Macha's emotion restored, she said:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">MACHA: I have been so lost for so long.
BEN: Macha?
MACHA: Please, forgive me. I couldn't bear to see my son suffering so much. I couldn't
bear it.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
After Mac Lir and Macha go to the light, we see Granny meet up with
her son and says:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">CONOR: We're all right now, Mum. We're all right now.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In perspective, Macha's redemption was only fulfilled by when Mac Lir
was awakened by Saoirse. Moments later, we have Granny's son
apologizing to her mother after relaying awaking from his own slumber.
To reiterate the words he used after meeting her wife:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">CONOR: It's as though I've been asleep,
</pre>
</div>

<p>
There is symmetry and flow. The mirroring of the characters make it so
that the fate of the family is tied with them. By helping the selkie
Saoirse, she wakes up Mac Lir and Macha move on, thus preventing
further stoning or sleeping of the spirit. Paralleling, Saoirse finds
her voice, she wakes up her father by calling there mother which
resolves Granny's problem. So whether the song should be global or
not, it does tie everyone akin to where destroying the villain
releases the curse. Convenience in logistics you can say. What I find
beautiful about the mirroring here is that you can see indirectly how
the resolution reflects each other which is not a coincidence.
</p>

<p>
The journey of Ben is the plight of the world. This is really subtle
and one might use the <b>world-type</b> story archetype or the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SekaikeiGenre">Sekaikei</a> but
that might be pushing it. For me, the scene of Saoirse singing is
quite cathartic even if it isn't obvious at first.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2b001e4">
<p>
If Macha was just a generic witch who hates the world and Mac Lir
didn't exist, I might be calling out that Saoirse is a savior; but
there is so much visual and symbolic subtlety and depth that I can't
help but see more in the song and the salvation. The story is simple
at face value where kids and adults can understand like with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Out_(2015_film)">Inside
Out (2015)</a> but also find depth in it. This is why this film is one of
my favorite animated film: beautiful and deep as the sea.

<p>
Will Saoirse sing for me to wake me up from my slumber?
