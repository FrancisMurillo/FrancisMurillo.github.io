<i><b>School Days tells a frustrating and frightening tale of an harem.</b></i>
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/2476/School_Days">School Days (2007)</a> is a pretty horrible show, in both senses of the
word. I dare not watch it again just to review or analyze it, so my
memory is my only lead but that I wish I have forgotten instead. As an
anime, it has horrible production and directing; as an story, it is
frustrating and aggravating to watch. So to say the difficulty of
watching this is high so I urge people to stay away from this despite
looking like a generic school love story.
</p>

<p>
After looking back at so many anime, I have to say this anime is
unique in the sense that it does what so many are afraid to do or try.
People love to hate this anime, but that is the point; the characters
and story are so abhorrent that you should hate it. If that was it's
objective then it has done a fantastic job. My purpose is not to
defend this anime but rather to understand its meaning and give me
some solace in watching it.
</p>

<p>
Although I urge people to avoid this but if you care about watching it
then <b>SPOILER WARNING</b> up ahead as I will mention the plot and more
so the ending.

<h2 id="org154eade">Summary</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org154eade">
<p>
From the top of my head, the story goes likes this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Boy has a crush on a girl</li>
<li>Female best friend helps in courting the girl</li>
<li>Boy goes in a relationship with said girl</li>
<li>Boy gets bored with girl and hooks up with best friend</li>
<li>Boy gets bored with best friend and hooks up with other friends</li>
<li>Boy gets best friend pregnant and hooks up with the first girl</li>
<li>Boy still hooks up with other friends</li>
<li>Betrayed pregnant friend kills boy</li>
<li>First girl kills pregnant friend</li>
<li>Insane first girl sleeps with the chopped head of the dead boy</li>
</ul>

<p>
In this summary the first three points are very familiar to most high
school romance, the rest end in a disastrous climax. If you are genre
savvy, this is indeed unique just from this plot. The main boy is
pretty disgusting for getting bored and cheating on her lover. The
women are questionable in themselves specially the best friend but
they are motivated primarily by the consequences of the main boy. At
the end the story it may be considered a good or bad ending depending
on how you see it: it is a good ending if you consider it reckoning or
judgment and a bad ending if you think about it traditionally as the
main character dying. This is the only solace I have is that the male
protagonist had it coming to him but it is still sad to see the damage
done to the women around him.

<p>
I do want to direct your attention as to who the main protagonist is.
His construction is that he looks generic that people can relate or
project themselves into him but so atrocious that you hate to be even
associated with him. Why create a contradictory main protagonist from
a character writing and genre point of view? The main characteristic
of a harem lead is usually just be nice or cool or lucky if that is a
trait so that the women will be impressed and collected in the harem.
So is it an artistic choice?
</p>

<p>
If you think about it, isn't this what men want? To be surrounded by
women and dream of hooking up with them? Case in point with harem (one
guy and more than two girls) shows but do not shack with them so that
it maintains the tension and prolongs the competition. In this anime,
the main protagonist shacks up with women in his harem thus fulfilling
the male or harem dream; and if he accidentally impregnate a woman, he
escapes responsibility while having more cake on the side. Isn't this
what a male would want? Isn't this who are main protagonist is? The
representation of the male's dream and harem? In a sense, the character
construction and choice is not contradictory but indicative to the
male desire and the story is merely playing it out. So in a sense this
is an ideal harem; however, this is not the story or end we want.
</p>

<p>
By stressing who the main character represents, this may be considered
a deconstruction of the harem genre by showing the dark end by
fulfilling it. If the word <i>deconstruction</i> sounds pretentious, the
word I use is <b>anti-harem</b>. Do we expect to be rewarded for being
unfaithful? Do we expect to be rewarded for being insensitive and
indecisive? Do we expect to be rewarded for escaping responsibilities?
Harems play with these notions for comedy and fan service but if taken
seriously should we really expect a happy ending? In consequence, are
harems really good?
</p>

<p>
If indeed this is the goal or objective of the anime, then it has done
a fantastic job. If you hated the characters, if you despised the
story, if you felt dirty at the end of it; then it's doing its job of
portraying the dangers of an harem. For all the anime I've watched, I
have to give it praise for having balls to present such an unpleasant
story even if you and I didn't enjoy it.

<p>
Is that what this anime really wanted to do or show? Regardless, it is
still a bad show just from its animation and direction. With that in
mind, was it just an accident that it might be an deconstruction? The
intention doesn't seem to match the production so I am not very
hopeful that I watched a poorly produced show. Now if this anime was
made with high grade production and animation, would I still watched
the show? If I knew it was an anti-harem, I might consider but I am
still not a fan of the genre so the chances are slim.
</p>

<p>
Looking at what it stands, would I want my harem to be typical or
grim? What I rather want of my shows is that they have meaning and
value, whatever genre that might be. At the least, I would not watch
shows that are poorly made although they might have meaning or mean
well.
