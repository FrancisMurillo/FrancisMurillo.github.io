<i><b>That Thing Called Tadhana uses its ending to undermine its</b></i>
<i><b>question and journey.</b></i>
</p>

<p>
Open ended endings are endings that leaves the resolution to the
audience. Or it can be a sequel-bait or cop-out depending on how it is
executed. If the ending answers the message, what happens to the
message when then ending is open? The simple answer is that the
message has no easy answer, that it cannot be just a yes or no. This
kind of ending wants to you to think about the message more than it
wants it answered which is why I have a soft spot for it when done
correctly.
</p>

<p>
I don't have high expectations for Tagalog movies since it is
populated with low brow romantic comedies. If I hear someone say
"pangmasa" again as an excuse for lack of quality, I will glare at
that person. Once in a while, there is a rare gem of a film that I can
be proud of being a Philippine movie goer. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Thing_Called_Tadhana">That Thing Called Tadhana
(2014)</a> is that rare gem despite appearing to be a romantic comedy.
</p>

<p>
At face value with the title and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvLVWTaUT5w">trailer</a>, it looks like a romantic
comedy that any genre savvy person would have seen more time than the
number of seats in a theater. Skeptical as I am even with the
accolades it has won, I approached this movie with apprehension and I
was happy to be wrong. By a casual viewing, this movie is refreshing
and down-to-earth which removed the need to break the mood with
needless comedy. Where this shines for me is how it asks what love
means in a relationship and how it executes its ending to support
that.
</p>

<p>
My focus will be on the main question it raises, the meaning of their
shared trip and what the ending's answer is.

<p>

</p>

<p>
The film is thankfully very simple and straightforward, it is explicit
with its symbols and is dialogue heavy; however, it has good
cinematography, several long takes and revels in its quiet moments
which is a rarity. Being genre savvy, it implies these two will move
on and hook up by the end and the film will preach to move on with
your life. By title alone the theme is if it is stupid to believe in
romantic fate or "tadhana".
</p>

<p>
With the same impression, the main question and the expectation of the
journey are in conflict: the former suggest that each of them will go
back since it is fate while the latter suggest that they move on and
hook up. Experiencing a breakup leads to the question of believing in
fate and as long as the question remains unresolved, so does the
heartache linger. Do you believe in the one you love or move on?
</p>

<p>
Typically, the endings gives the answer or which it sides but first
let us take a look at the actors and what side they represent.
</p>

<h2 id="orgd2cefe0">The Journey</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd2cefe0">
<p>
In understanding the characters, let's see the mechanics in which they
grow. Two well-adjusted people meet up accidentally while take a
sight-seeing journey, what a simple way to express moving on from
heartache. No concern of money and circumstance but of heartache and
solace.
</p>

<p>
Let's take a look our characters from their heartache.

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/that-thing-called-tadhana--mace.png" alt="Screenshot Of Mace"/>
</p>

<p>
The woman who was left behind by his boyfriend for a better future in
another country. Some time later, she decided to visit his boyfriend
but only found him living with another woman. After that, she feels
torn and carries the ache with her; but she still loves him despite
being tired and hurt. She tried to fight but lost and now carries
that pain.
</p>

<p>
In the view of romantic fate, she believed and acted for her lover
but wasn't reciprocated in the end.

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/that-thing-called-tadhana--anthony.png" alt="Screenshot Of Anthony"/>
</p>

<p>
The man who refused marriage and lost his girlfriend in the process.
It his not that he didn't love his girlfriend but that his girlfriend
demanded more responsibility and commitment which he could not give
at the time. She left him but he did not chase her, letting fate
decide if they are meant to be. Without action, he has moved on but
still feels empty.
</p>

<p>
Using the previous lens, his inaction shows belief in it because if
she is his destiny then she will come back but is rebuked and
suffering for his choice since he knows that she has settled down and
has a family.
</p>

<h3 id="orgad29ac6">The Heart And The Arrow</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgad29ac6">
<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/that-thing-called-tadhana--the-heart-and-the-arrow.png" alt="Screenshot Of The Heart And The Arrow"/>
</p>

<p>
The unfinished story of Mace about the heart and the arrow is
representative of both the Mace and Anthony and their relationship.
In this story, Mace is the heart while Anthony the arrow. According
to it, the heart slid of the arrow because the arrow kept
denying that was his; the lack of commitment from the arrow made the
heart move on but the arrow still felt empty. Importantly, this
analogy is foreshadowing the end of their journey.
</p>

<p>
The film's lens indicates that both believed but acted differently
thus symbolizing their stances.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="org2f15d17">End Of The Road</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2f15d17">
<p>
I can delve into how quaint and nice their journey is but it is the
end of the pilgrimage that is most intriguing. When returning from
their vacation, they find Mace's former lover at her doorstep wanting
to get back to her which Anthony goes on ahead.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/that-thing-called-tadhana--the-end-of-the-tale.png" alt="Screenshot Of The End"/>
</p>

<p>
This scene undermines the whole journey as well as magnify the
positions the characters are. In one perspective, they are their
former lovers where Anthony is the one who leaves and is never chased
while Mace is the one found with another man and is being begged.
Fulfilling their roles in the tale, the arrow when confronted denied
staying with the heart and let her slip off once more.
</p>

<p>
If you breakdown the action of each character, it means different for
each of them and what the journey means. Anthony has first choice
whether to fight for Mace or leave, it reflects his growth on the
journey but is ultimately meaningless as he goes ahead. Next, Mace
has a choice of asking Anthony to stay, it shows her acceptance in
moving on but again denied. Lastly, Anthony has the final choice of
fighting for Mace, which would indicate his commitment and love for
her but instead gives way. At each step, there is a thematic
significance and questioning of the message and journey itself.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgc2349f4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc2349f4">Ambiguity</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc2349f4">
<p>
I liked it that Mace's former lover is not truly characterized. We do
not know why he left her, we do not know the circumstance of him
coming back, and we will never know his intentions; at the least, he
has come back to fulfill fate or returning to the one you love. With
this however, it seems to invalidate the growth of the journey.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/that-thing-called-tadhana--the-completed-tale.png" alt="Screenshot Of The Completed Tale"/>
</p>

<p>
The final scene of the film has Anthony finish the incomplete story of
Mace and decides to find her and fight for her once more which is both
stereotypical and subversive in context. He fights for her after
losing her which is indeed typical of a romantic comedy but the
subversion here is we don't know what happened to Mace. It might be
futile but he now plays the role of Mace in this regard, that their
time together might afford one more chance. The film then leaves the
audience with a shot of the completed book leaving us with an open
ending.
</p>

<p>
Here is where the tale takes a deeper meaning. Mace's unfinished tale
is open-ended or without closure. Anthony giving it an ending and form
is symbolic of the film itself. However, until he gives it to her, it
is not complete which still leaves the events open as before. We don't
know if this action is ultimately futile or romantic but isn't that
what love is? Blind and stupid and also a dream.
</p>

<p>
So in the end, what is the meaning of the ending being unresolved?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd09359d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd09359d">Staying In Love</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd09359d">
<p>
Examining the theme of romantic fate. If you believe in romantic fate,
you are positioned to have Mace in a relationship and Anthony fail in
his endeavor. If you don't, you believe Mace will reject her former
lover and accept Anthony in the ending. In either case, Mace's former
lover symbolizes the goal of the journey; by rejecting him rejects the
belief, but by accepting him rejects the journey.
</p>

<p>
Despite these contradictions, neither is it wrong to believe in
romantic fate nor fighting against it. Imagination and lust is what
writes stories while strength and desire is why we fight against it.
To accept and deny fate is both romantic. If the ending does choose a
side, it denies one that makes romances very subtle and complex. Love
is not a size fits all, sometimes letting things be and sometimes
fighting are valid actions as shown by Mace. So by leaving the ending
open, it neither denies itself at the same time the complexity of
being stupidly in love. You know, you idiots.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/that-thing-called-tadhana--opening-lines.png" alt="Screenshot Of The Opening Lines"/>
</p>

<p>
Moving on is not wrong but it shows how waiting and letting things
boil is also an option. If Mace waited and never took the journey, she
is justified in her belief and patient by letting her lover miss her;
but the journey gave her strength while sleeping on it. Acting and
waiting. This shows that neither belief is completely wrong and can
coexist.
</p>

<p>
That is also why this ending makes sense in context, because no one is
ultimately wrong. One could take sides, find reason out who is more
justified or discover interpretations but finding who is meant for
each other is really the sentiment. I am not an expert in love, I
merely understand the struggle presented by Mace and Anthony and I
hope they find their destiny.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge824c05" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge824c05">Meta Conflict</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge824c05">
<p>
Understanding the meta-conflict, the showdown at the end is subverted
by not being loud and dramatic. The scene typically ends up where the
man pleads to the woman and getting back together; however, this scene
is presented as a real issue for the main couple hooking up at the
same time making their relationship secondary. At the same time,
Anthony leaving subverts the typical need to fight during a conflict
and show the woman his love; his leaving can be interpreted as
allowing Mace to find closure which shows more concern for her while
also fulfilling the failed scenario of a having a problem before truly
hooking up. Lastly, showing they aren't together in the end is the
most obvious subversion.
</p>

<p>
This film is full of subverted expectations which doubles in showing
how complicated the circumstances are for this film. Rejecting the
expectations is rejecting the notion of being boxed in about romantic
fate.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgc34cbdc" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc34cbdc">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc34cbdc">
<p>
So the use of open-ended ending here explores romantic fate whereas
the use of it in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Words">The Garden Of Words</a> explores maturity in relationship
and both films are stronger for doing so. That is why I have a soft
spot for it, it doesn't need to answer itself but let the audience be
immersed by the possibility and meaning. I recommend this film if not
for the meaningful ending and subversion, but by the simple and
reserved romance it presents.
