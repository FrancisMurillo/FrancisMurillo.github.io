<i><b>Kimi no Na wa message deviates from the creator's previous works</b></i>
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Name">Kimi no Na wa (2016)</a> is one of Makoto Shinkai's beautiful work. It is
visually magnificent, spectacularly directed and romantically moving.
Praises and adulation, nothing less from his works and I would love to
rewatch it. After noting how great it is from a viewing experience, I
now want to talk about what its message and to me.
</p>

<p>
If you watched the film and any of his previous works, I urge you to
consider and think about the message of this film. Do think about it
even for a minute. After thinking long and hard about it, I have
nothing. Nothing. The film is a great romance but what else is it? Is
it about isolation or dreaming? Is it about time travel or ghosts? Is
it about the underworld or dreams? I cannot see an underlying message
compared to his other previous works which makes me sad. This is such
a departure from what I like about his works: beautiful inside and
out.
</p>

<p>
If you can find any meaningful message in this film, do shoot me an
email and you can skip my nil analysis. Otherwise, let's talk about
his previous work in comparison to this one.
</p>

<p>
<b>SPOILER WARNING</b>
</p>

<h2 id="orge6d6cbb">Present</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge6d6cbb">
<p>
Let me summarize the film:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Boy swaps bodies with a girl periodically and mysteriously</li>
<li>The boy as the girl helps her in her life and vice-versa</li>
<li>Boy and girl get used to each other swapping</li>
<li>They stop swapping</li>
<li>Boy finds where girl lives</li>
<li>Boy discovers girl is a ghost from the past</li>
<li>Boy swaps with the girl to save her from her death</li>
<li>Boy saves her but both forget there lover's name</li>
<li>Time skip where boy and girl feels something missing</li>
<li>Boy and girl reunite with both asking there names</li>
</ul>

<p>
Again it is a nice romantic tale and nothing wrong with that. Digging
deeper into this list there are varying notions that one can look up
further. This is not a comprehensive breakdown but more of an
impression, so I may be wrong but I don't think it will deviate from
the flow
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org658af4f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org658af4f">Ghosts</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org658af4f">
<p>
So the reason why they can switch bodies periodically or every other
day is that the girl is a ghost: the girl possesses the body of the
boy while the boy relives the memory the girl on the same day. Also
they communicate using there phones via their journals and reading it
the other day. Clever enough.
</p>

<p>
There are just some weird things I can ask about this such how one
could translate to each others live without much fuss and why aren't
they scared about it but it more of nitpick on my part which I can
let slide.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbd3defe" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgbd3defe">Time Travel</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbd3defe">
<p>
So the girl is a ghost from the past and reliving the memories of the
past. So how does the boy save the girl from the past? Time travel.
By consuming a fermented wine made by the girl, he can trigger a body
swap where it affects the past? I'm a little sketchy on this but I
understand there is a form of recursion and has been foreshadowed by
the threaded bracelet the girl makes.
</p>

<p>
I would understand he can recall the memory but not affect it but
there is an emphasis on the mystical and Japanese so I can't really
speak about it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgfae1c27" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgfae1c27">Red Thread</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfae1c27">
<p>
The boy and girl are related by a red thread of sort both physically
and visually. The girl has given the boy a red threaded bracelet, the
boy travels through time through a red thread, the girl has a red
hair band and they meet through a red stairway. I understand the red
thread of fate symbolizes there connection or love that will connect
them through time.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgc360a7d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc360a7d">Message</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc360a7d">
<p>
So love that is tied through time is quite romantic but is there
anything else? The use of red, the string of fate, and time travel
seem to just point to romance but what does the romance mean?
</p>

<p>
What if they never met each other? It would contradict the red string
of fate. How is there longing portrayed after forgetting there names?
Not much but several scenes hooking up the side characters. What is
the meaning of the comet breaking apart? So that they can be tied to
a global cosmic event.
</p>

<p>
What if there is really no message? If that is true, I fear for the
next films of Shinkai for it will merely look pretty to everyone,
that itself is okay. However, I go to his films because of the
meaning and message you have to think and interpret.
</p>

<h2 id="orgaa22924">Past</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgaa22924">
<p>
So let me list his previous films and what I think my quick
interpretations are, it might be wrong or right but I have yet to
analyze and rewatch them more thoroughly.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Place_Promised_in_Our_Early_Days">The Place Promised in Our Early Days (2004)</a></dt><dd>Dreams are not as important as reality</dd>

<dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Words">The Garden of Words (2013)</a></dt><dd>Accepting responsibility</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Again these are just quick rundowns, if I were to rewatch them again I
might have a different answer with some new insight. That's the thing
though: I have an answer. With this film, I have none. For me, the
clincher is that with them I had a meaningful impact beyond the
romance that I kept thinking about it.
</p>

<p>
Each one deserves a post looking at there theme and message but for
now I will give a short message about each one. Again, this is my
current interpretation which is probably incomplete so take a grain of
salt.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga27a88b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga27a88b">The Place Promised in Our Early Days</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga27a88b">
<p>
Starting the list is where I am confused the most. A quick rundown of
the story formula would be:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Boy and best bro meet girl</li>
<li>Comatose girl disappears and boys grieve over her</li>
<li>Best bro finds girl</li>
<li>Main boy finds a way to wake up the girl</li>
<li>Boy does so but girl forgets her feelings</li>
<li>Happily ever after?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Among his works, this is the first one that uses time travel or
parallel worlds like our main film but it is a little more
convoluted. What I want to focus more is the tower, which seems to
represent the dream of the world and the theme of dreams in the film.
This single solitary tower can be seen by everyone as a symbol of a
place people can go and dream and share a common dream. The major
plot point about this tower is that it takes the girl inside it so
that the tower can tell the dreams to the girl. Yes, the tower for
some reason and how and if it is alive or not takes the girl as a
hostage for the boy to save. So the boys fly a plane to take the girl
inside the tower and then blow it up. Convoluted.
</p>

<p>
What I find confusing about this film is that they blow up the tower
and imply it is an happy ending although the feelings of the girl is
lost or forgotten. If the tower represents the dream of the boy and
girl and they destroyed it, does that mean there dreams are less
important than being together? There is another angle of two nations
being united by the destruction of the tower but the tower itself was
made by one of the nations, there dream of sort. One final angle is
where the world's made by the tower is the dream of the universe, on
what the possibilities are. If you take the destruction of the tower
as symbol for accepting reality over dreams for all parties, that for
me is not a happy ending but a bittersweet one.
</p>

<p>
Of course that is my interpretation. By looking at the film as is,
boy getting the girl is a good ending. But by saving her she forgets
her feelings, what does that mean? Perhaps to add drama at the end.
If you consider that when the girl was taken and that her dream was
to tell her how he loves the main boy, then losing those feeling is
an indirect consequence. However, the dream of being together is what
ties there romance, by being together they are actually distant. As
the bittersweet violin piece played by the girl, the symbolic ending
for this film is very bittersweet. The harsh reality.
</p>

<p>
If you ask me the ending would be that they leave the girl there and
leave the tower alone because to dream is what keeps everyone alive,
not together.

<h3 id="org7b1fec9">5 Centimeters Per Second</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7b1fec9">
<p>
The film that got me into his other films and is my favorite. I
consider this the essential Shinkai film because it tackles isolation
and relationship more in depth than the others which I think is his
focal points in making these films. This film is unique that it is
presented as a combination of three short stories but in essence you
may consider this a three act story:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Showing the romance between the boy and the girl</li>
<li>Exploring the growing distance between them</li>
<li>Accepting that they can never be together and moving on</li>
</ul>

<p>
Most people consider this a sad ending but I consider this a good and
cathartic ending as the final scene with the trains indicate both of
them going there separate way and accepting it. I have to praise
Shinkai for showing a story of romance growing distant that is
succinct and heartbreaking. In contrast with the previous film, this
is where accepting reality is much more positive than disheartening.
By rejecting the fantasy of being together it allows them to move on,
what a strong message to put. No one needs saving like in the
previous film, only saving oneself from needless sorrow.
</p>

<p>
I have really nothing much to say except on how you interpret it,
this is still the strongest film in his repertoire in terms of
meaning. I really love how this connects emotionally and
intellectually appeasing to consume which took me a long time to
think about.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7457d1e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7457d1e">Children Who Chase Lost Voices</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7457d1e">
<p>
My second favorite Shinkai film in terms of his message. A quick
rundown would be:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Girl meets boy</li>
<li>Boy dies</li>
<li>Girl grieves</li>
<li>Girl and her undercover teacher find the entrance to the underworld</li>
<li>Both journey together to revive a lost one</li>
<li>Girl decides to leave but teacher stays on the quest</li>
<li>Tying the threads up</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is a straightforward film about accepting death and grief and
moving on. Nothing truly complicated about this film but it is still
leaves a strong impact on me. Would you take a journey to be together
with ones that have left you? I might consider it but no and it
leaves me in tears that you can but it may not be the what we really
want. Such is the nature of grief.
</p>

<p>
Again, nothing truly complicated but there may be references and
issues you can spot and think about it further. One that comes into
mind where the girl is being chased by the shadows, think what you
may about despair or rape.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org8684267" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8684267">Garden Of Words</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8684267">
<p>
Another gem of a film. The usual rundown:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Boy meets older woman when it rains</li>
<li>Boy keeps meeting with woman</li>
<li>Boy realizes the woman is her teacher</li>
<li>Boy and teacher comes to term with there state in life</li>
<li>Boy and teacher never meetup</li>
</ul>

<p>
You may hone in on the use of light, rain and shoes signifying the
truth, isolation and moving on respectively. Some people might find
the fascination of the boy with making shoes a little queer and the
backstory might phone in Freud but I do like this film. What stands
out is the open ending, which has a greater weight on what there
relationship means or stands for. The boy wants to please an older
woman as how her mother does and the woman depends on a partner to be
emotionally stable. Near the end, the boy makes a pair of shoe at the
end but leaves it there while the woman is teaching and it never
rains but snows. It implies that both have moved on from there issue
but never destined to meet as it shows snow and the boy leaving the
pair instead of waiting and coming back. Leaving there ending and
relationship closed and open is very moving.
</p>

<p>
Of course, you can say it will rain meaning that they will meet each
other but the question is what did there relationship mean?
Culturally in Japan, there relationship might be odd since the man is
the primary provider but here it is the older woman; if they continue
there relationship would it be socially awkward and would it be
proper in other context? For me there relationship stemmed from there
shared isolation from the world, they grew together from it thus
there relationship has no further points. I'm not saying that they
should or should not meet but it the relationship in my head is
consumed or fulfilled, there is no need or urgency. That is the fun
thing about the meaning of there relationship, it is open for
interpretation on what you think it would be. It is not exactly deep
but it stays with you.
</p>

<p>
Whether they are to be or not, it has weight and meaning on the
message of the film just with the previous films.
</p>

<h2 id="orgbaac656">Message</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbaac656">
<p>
So we come back to our original film and what it means. If you cut out
the part after the town is saved, it is just a sad ending but since it
is there it is a good one. That's the thing it is just a matter of a
sad or happy, whether they get back together or not has no meaning or
message. Hypothetically, if they never met up what is the film telling
you? Never get mixed up with ghosts? If they did meet up what did it
mean? Magic exists? So what did it mean?
</p>

<p>
That is why I think this movie is pretty but hollow. However, why
should it matter it if did have a message or not when it is well made?
Actually it does not, I simply wanted to point out that this is his
first film where it has no meaning. For now it passes but as soon as
he makes another one that has no meaning then he might head to the
path of the pretty romantic film. For me, I love his films for its
beauty and depth and that's why I was eagerly anticipating this film
but stayed at the credits wondering what just happened. Where was the
thought provoking aspect of being in a relationship?
</p>

<p>
You can say that was what he was going for and if so then well done
but the use of time travel and ghosts is overkill just to have a body
swapping story. I would be okay if the mechanics of body swapping were
never revealed like in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midori_Days">Midori Days</a>, you simple accepted it as part of
the story. I would be okay if this movie was about long distance
relationships but the second act was simply to forget there names and
resolve the mechanic leaving a hollow message on what there
relationship means. If it was focused more on understanding through
body swapping or having a distant relationship could be close, I might
be hailing him.
</p>

It doesn't matter although I find this alarming. I await his next
film as with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamoru_Hosoda">Mamoru Hosoda</a> and be amazed by there spectacular works.
Again, this is a strong romantic film and I would be eager to rewatch
it and maybe find the real message. Here ends the observation of a
Shinkai fan.
