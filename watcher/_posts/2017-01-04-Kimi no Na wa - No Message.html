<i><b>Kimi no Na wa has no obvious message about an aspect of relationships.</b></i>
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Name">Kimi no Na wa (2016)</a> is one of Makoto Shinkai's beautiful work. It is
visually magnificent, spectacularly directed and romantically moving.
Praises and adulation, nothing less from his works and I would love to
rewatch it. After noting how great it is from a viewing experience, I
now want to talk about what it means to me.
</p>

<p>
As a fan of his previous films, what I look for in his works are both
beauty and meaning. After watching his films, I am lost in thought and
emotion, asking for closure and meaning. However, I am not assuming
you have seen his previous films, rather I will give my own
interpretations and contrast it with this film.
</p>

<p>
<b>SPOILER WARNING for this this and his previous films.</b>
</p>

<h2 id="orgf267586">Present</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf267586">
<p>
This film is a romantic story based on a body swapping mechanic. Not
unique but the presentation of the relationship and cinematic
execution is what makes this standout. And that Shinkai touch.
</p>

<p>
In the lens of a three part act, the first act introduces their
relationship brought about by the body swapping, the second act stops
the swappingg and brings much needed mechanical exposition, the last
act is the meeting of time and space. To elaborate the mechanic, the
girl exists in a time three years before the boy and swap time and
place every other day. The reason for it might be due to the magic of
the circling comet and the hint that the boy's family itself might be
time travellers. The actual mechanic itself is a little strange that I
believe ghosts and out-of-body experiences served a more believable
explanation than time travel. Regardless of errors in actual
reasoning, my sentiment and thoughts are valid.
</p>

<p>
So on my initial viewing, I stayed behind until the credits rolled
because I could not think how it failed to ask questions about aspects
of a relationship. I make this statement on the basis of asking if the
main characters meeting has meaning aside from closure or catharsis. I
find it hard to believe that this film is has nothing to say aside
from having a nice teenage romance, which is not wrong but strange.

<h2 id="org703d63e">Looking For Meaning</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org703d63e">
<p>
A film may or may not have meaning or message. A film may be for a
casual or artistic experience, so it is not required. My case is that
after watching so many films, I want to find and watch films that are
more than enjoyment. Although I do have moods in watching, I can only
watch so many that I have to choose those with literal meaning and
value.
</p>

<p>
My general claim is that if a film has a message, it has more value
than a film that doesn't. The judge is primarily execution and
context, a bad film can have a message and a good film can have none.
As a cerebral watcher, it is the message or themes that resonate and
stays with me after the film rather than the emotional punch at the
end. I am merely maximizing my time in watching, but it's good to have
fun as well.
</p>

<p>
I understand that there are pretentious films and that this is my
personal gripe but I had my expectations for a Shinkai film: beautiful
inside and out. If you want to understand my expectations, let's look
at what his previous films said.

</p>

<p>
This film is more complicated mechanically than the main film since
it uses parallel worlds and scientific babble. Plotholes and
complexities, there is a tower reaching the heavens which unites
everyone in hope and dream, to reach the heavenly tower. For some
reason, this tower took the main girl into itself and where the main
boy gets into a chopper, gets the girl inside and destroys the tower.
A little more complex than it has to be to present a romantic story.
</p>

<p>
It took me quite a while to come to terms with this film and the
easiest explanation I can give is this: the tower represents dreams
and by destroying and getting the girl, reality is not as important.
Put in another way, instead of dreaming of being together, let us be
together.
</p>

<p>
To add to this, there is a war where two countries are struggling and
between them is the tower. A resistance force wants to unify the two
by destroying it thereby removing the towering distance between them.
</p>

<p>
More directly, the girl inside the tower and the boy outside dreams
to be together. The tower is their promised place but by destroying
it to free the girl, they have literally destroyed their paradise to
be together.
</p>

<p>
The tower represents that place in the distance that people can dream
and share together, thus the symbolic ending is disheartening. Is it
wrong to dream and live in that paradise?
</p>

<p>
It is a complicated film but it has a message, although not something
I endorse. In comparison to this theme and setup, I would prefer to
watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Space_Force:_The_Wings_of_Honn%C3%AAamise">Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honeeamise</a> as the simple
symbolism of an everyday man of dreaming to launch to space is much
more triumphant.

</p>

<p>
This film is the reason why I am a Shinkai fan. It is a literal
three-part structure represented by short stories, the first part
shows the relationship between the leads, the second piece the
distant growing between them, the last indicates how far they are.
From the outset, I praise this film for showing how people get
distant over time, a rare topic to cover. Although the film appears
to be a sad, it is actually a happy one by showing the main
protagonist moving on.
</p>

<p>
Here the relationship has meaning. Although the can get close
physically, they are worlds apart. During their separation, the woman
has found a life while the man is longing for her too much. If they
did hook up, it would simply be a tale in fate and destiny. However,
by choosing to move on, it shows acceptance of things that cannot be.
No matter how close they get, they are worlds apart despite how they
dream of those early days.
</p>

<p>
This is a subversion on the romantic ending and relationship that is
well executed in tackling isolation and longing in a simple and
realistic relationship. This is the essential Shinkai film in my eyes
from which others are judged. Moving on.

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/kimi-no-na-wa--children-who-chase-lost-voices.png" alt="Screenshot Of Children Who Chase Lost Voices"/>
</p>

<p>
This film is standout from the roster. First, the message is very
easy to understand, accepting grief. Nothing much to say or do with
its simplicity but not that it is bad. If you consider grief as
longing, then it is a reasonable theme for a Shinkai film.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, this has a magical world much more akin to a Studio Ghibli
film. Perhaps from social pressure of being a Miyazaki which is not
needed as with Mamoru Hosoda? Not that I discourage it, he already
has a distinct style that I appreciate.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, the film has no romantic relationship to address, instead the
question is changed to should they call for their dearly departed?
The least Shinkai film.
</p>

<p>
This film is not a masterpiece of story telling or world building but
it does address grief on a journey to the other world simply.

</p>

<p>
My second favorite Shinkai film while being a return to form from the
previous one. It presents a relationship between a high schooler and
a teacher in a way that puts them on equal footing. Their meetings on
rainy morning in a park is an escapist paradise, where people who can
be isolated from their fear. Through their meetings, they grow a
relationship that transcend status and responsibility. It is a true
Shinkai film.
</p>

<p>
At some point in the film, the illusion is shattered and their
relationship meets up with reality. Questioning both the maturity of
the student and the responsibility of the teacher. What makes this
different is that it ends on an open ending. By using such, the
relationship is allowed a new start when both are more mature in
their lives, instead of forcing an issue of age, status and
responsibility.
</p>

<p>
Among his previous films, this is the most complex in terms of
understanding which I appreciate. A similar theme is done by <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&amp;uddg=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFLCL">FLCL</a> but
I prefer this for how much you have to look and think about the
meaning of their relationship.

<p>
<i><b>What does it mean for the characters to be in a relationship?</b></i>
</p>

<p>
So the previous films have clearly a message about an aspect of
relationship. Whether is it dreams, grief, maturity or distance, the
main relationship has a question to answer. Coming back to the main
film, what does it mean for the main characters to be in a
relationship?
</p>

<p>
If they meet up, it merely means fate and destiny; if they did not, do
not mess with time travel. For the life of me, I cannot think of a
deeper meaning to the film aside from the body swapping mechanics.
Sitting in that theatre, I felt disappointed intellectually.
</p>

<p>
In retrospect, this film is unique in that regard. Just being a solid
teenage romance story but it feels hollow. For me, I watch Shinkai
film because it has meaning, something most films can't give me.

<p>
Again, this is just my personal gripe, but I am marking this film.
Anyhow, it is still a commercial success so I hope that funds a more
meaningful film. Nonetheless, I still recommend this film but I would
strongly recommend instead <span class="underline">5 Centimeters Per Second</span> or <span class="underline">The Garden
of Words</span>.
