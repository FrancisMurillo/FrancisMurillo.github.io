* Dogville

  /*Dogville removes superfluous walls to examine moral actions*/

  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogville][Dogville (2003)]] is a unique yet difficult film to watch. Aside from
  using three hours and nine chapters like Quentin Tarantino's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hateful_Eight][The
  Hateful Eight]]. It presents a town with no walls but only a chalk
  outline akin to an architectural blueprint. A town that is bare of
  superfluous details such as walls and trees and roads and fence, just
  the space where people live.

  I like director, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_von_Trier][Lars von Trier]], and his other work [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melancholia_%25282011_film%2529][Melancholia]] for
  tackling different issues such as depression although his camera work
  and visuals are somewhat stagnant. To compensate for the lack of
  visuals, it must have a strong story or compelling characters. If you
  have seen this and made it through, then it is for you to decide if it
  is.

  My focal point of dicussion is on the use of the setting and how it
  correlates to its message. The message itself is somewhat direct with
  a little subversion on tropes so I won't discuss that here.

  *SPOILER ALERT*

* A Town With No Walls

  The audience can see the town has no walls but the actors are confined
  by the space which they live in. This is akin to a stage play where
  everything has been stripped to the bare minimum only to focus on the
  actors. It is a strange setup indeed for a long and experimental film
  but what does it really do? You may say it is a gimick to reduce
  setting cost and excuse shoddy cinematography to which I might agree;
  however, there is a thematic reason why it is used.

  At a face value, this allows the audience to see the actors behind
  walls. Obvious but misleading since the camera controls the viewpoint.
  The true value of it can be seen from this unseen and horrendous rape
  scene:

  The audience sees the sexual assault but not the actors. Not only does
  this heighten the devious act, this emphasizes the distance and denial
  the towns people have. They are near but cannot or refuses to see what
  is next to them. This disonnance between what the audience and actors
  sees is what this setup bring.

  However, it is not enough to justify it with a scene or two. To give
  it meaning, it must be tied to the message or story of the film. The
  town spiritual and moral leader is a philosopher, so this films hints
  at saying something moral. A critical line from this philosopher is:

  /*The whole country would be better served with a greater attitude of*/
  /*openness and acceptance*/

  Openness and acceptance. Hipocricy and denial, to be exact. By laying
  down the extraneous walls, the town and its people are laid bare for
  the audience to examine.

* Reflection

  After the hardships, hipocricy and cruelty the town has displayed to
  Grace, the judgment at the end is well deserved although you could
  reason more about it. More importantly, the initial decision to show
  mercy yet reconsider wrath instead is very appropriate. Her reasoning
  to be a martyr or merciful is hypocritical to what she reasons out,
  which the film discusses with little for me to say. The theme of
  self-examination runs deep.

  The people themselves are deceptive in being kind at first but treat
  her harshly later on and deny their abuse and wrongdoing. No one is
  innocent specially the philosopher who merely uses words to his own
  benefit.

  When Grace attempts to leave, no one bothered asking what they did
  wrong in why should a person leave their small community. Instead,
  they tie her up to a proxy ball-and-chain. This film is hard to watch
  because of the treatment and reality of Grace, which might happen to
  anyone. A dark interpretation of human morality.

  Going back to our setup, aside from the town's ironic geographic
  emotional size, it reflects how little in the town really matters.
  Since majority of the details could be removed even the dog, there is
  little to care for about the town and by extension its people.

  [[img:watcher/images/dogville--dog.png][Screenshot Of The Dog]]

  In a way, this supports Grace's decision to remove this morally
  deceitful town. Notice the one that remains after the massacre is the
  unknowing and pure dog. It goes a bit more abstract.

* Abstraction

  #+BEGIN_SRC text
    GRACE: Why not just call it Dogville?
    TOM: Wouldn't work. No, it wouldn't work. It's got to be universal.
    TOM: A lot of writers make that mistake.

  #+END_SRC

  Finally, the philospher indicates in naming his realized book to be a
  universal name, not theirs furthering the meaning. However, it does
  raise the point why the town is called Dogville. By joining the two
  lines together, it indicates that the town itself is symbolic of
  cruelty and hipocrisy happening anywhere.

  So what if we imagine transparent walls around our homes, what would
  it look like? Would it be just as Dogville be? If so would, that our
  morality and courtesy be only our advantage? This is the literal
  meaning of the setup, what is a world without walls? Do we want to see
  beyond what our minds allow like bullying, abuse or rape in society?

  Honestly as a hipocrite, I do not want to see what beyond the walls.
  In that sense, is my morality truly a convenience? In general, is
  morality that transparently empty?

  Obviously there is more philosophical but this is the message of the
  film. So in my opinion, the use of transparent walls was used to good
  effect. A unique setup that I won't probably see in a long time.

* Conclusion

  The film is pretty straightforward in its meaning although long and
  chatty. If you can stomach it, I encourage you to watch this gut
  wrenching film for its unique story and depiction of morality. As for
  me, it is one of my new favorite film that I cannot rewatch without
  effort.
