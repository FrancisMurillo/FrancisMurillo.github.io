<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_and_Then%2C_Here_and_There">Now and Then, Here and There (200)</a> is a fascinating anime. Plainly, it
is about a kid who is sucked to another world by helping a mysterious
girl and wants to return home. Going to the other world, he must save
her and possibly overthrow the hegemony of a mad dictator. It seems
similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a> but far from its childish playfulness.
I like this anime not for its dark themes but how it presents its
story. It is gripping and hypnotizing all throughout without being
dramatic or superfluous although this is not for the faint of heart or
the casual.
</p>

</p>

<p>
What inspired me to write an article is its ending. After watching, I
felt stunned and lost. This analysis is a way for me to cope and
understand and what it all meant. That itself is saying much about my
experience and its quality.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>SPOILERS AHEAD</b></i>
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org35590e7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org35590e7">The End</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org35590e7">
<p>
We start at the end: the ending. As the usual story goes, our
protagonist, Shu, returns home and the castle in the sky destroyed. In
that respect, the ending should be a joyous occasion. Sadly, Lala
vanishing makes the adventure fruitless from a hero's perspective.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/now-and-then-here-and-there--the-sunset.png" alt="Screenshot Of The Sunset"/>
</p>

<p>
This is compounded by Sara staying in the other world. Initially, she
has the strongest desire to go back; by choosing to give life, she
hopes that all her suffering will bear fruit someday.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/now-and-then-here-and-there--sara-reason.png" alt="Screenshot Of Sara's Reason"/>
</p>

<p>
When all said is done, Shu is back to where he came from. Nothing is
brought or returned as if everything was a dark dream.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/now-and-then-here-and-there--going-back.png" alt="Screenshot Of Going Back"/>
</p>

<p>
With the final lingering shot, <b>how can we interpret this ending?</b> In
comparison, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_(1939_film)">The Wizard of Oz (1939)</a> resolves issues within the dream
while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia">The Chronicles of Narnia series</a> carries lessons over. Here, our
protagonist has no issue aside from being a rash and impulsive boy. In
the end, he still is a rash and impulsive boy although slightly
improved.
</p>

<p>
This ending can be a case for the futility of war. What did all the
fighting accomplish? Nothing but the loss of Nabuca, Sis, Boo and
countless other lives. It can be also the value of life since Shu
persuades people to live and Sara keeping the baby despite strong
reasons to the contrary. Many interpretations exist but how do we go
about it? To begin our analysis, I want to focus on an element of the
story: <b>character development</b>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga89e45f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga89e45f">Character Development</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga89e45f">
<p>
A character with much development is Sara; despite being the
protagonist, Shu does not change or develop. Another way to put it is
that the other world has changed Sara while it left Shu unchanged.
This idea can be explored with Nabuca and Tabool.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/now-and-then-here-and-there--nabuca-vs-tabool.png" alt="Screenshot Of Nabuca vs Tabool"/>
</p>

<p>
Both of them came from the same village yet are changed differently.
In power, Nabuca is clearly stronger and controlled than Tabool; in
status, Nabuca is a faithful soldier while Tabool is a political
animal. As with Shu and Sara, both wanted to go home yet decide
differently. Near the end, Nabuca wants to stop killing while Tabool
wants to continue and eventually take over Hamdo's empire. That
difference culminates in Tabool betraying Nabuca to exemplify his
intention.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/now-and-then-here-and-there--tabool-betrayal.png" alt="Screenshot Of Tabool's Betrayal"/>
</p>

<p>
Regardless, both of them die and consequently neither of them go back
to their village; however, Nabuca has a more meaningful story death
than Tabool whose death last less than a second of screen time.
Another way of looking at it is that since both were changed by the
war, the story does not allow them to return home.
</p>

<p>
Thinking about our main pair, Shu returns home with his morals while
Sara does not who was broken by captivity. When their values were
tested, Shu does not kill Nabuca while Sara kills her rapist.
Therefore, <b>is this story talking about maintaining humanity?</b>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org036a813" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org036a813">Humanity and Backstory</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org036a813">
<p>
How does war change people? Rather, <b>how does war break people?</b> Shu
could have been broken several times in the story but remains rooted.
Despite having little development, he is the only character that keeps
his values, a fixed point.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/now-and-then-here-and-there--the-wooden-soldier.png" alt="Screenshot Of Shu's Testimony"/>
</p>

<p>
What is humanity or integrity? A complex question for anyone to
answer. Here, I mean it as a quality of keeping character and belief
but that itself is a vague answer. Instead, I want to point out
another element in the story that relates to it: <b>backstory or the
lack of it</b>.
</p>

<p>
Given thirteen episodes, what do we know about our characters? Nothing
substantial. I do not know who Shu, Lala, Nabuca or anyone else. Why
is Hamdo crazy? Was he a good person before he went crazy for Lala?
Why is Abelia faithful to Hamdo? Were Nabuca and Tabool good kids
before? How old is Lala? Why is Shu naive to a fault? I can go on but
the backstory is definitely lacking or missing.
</p>

<p>
Commonly, a backstory is used to empathize and understand a
character's motivation and actions. The key word is empathy. By
empathizing on characters, it changes your perception or judgment on
their action and consequences.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/now-and-then-here-and-there--hamdo-death.png" alt="Screenshot Of Hamdo's Death"/>
</p>

<p>
Consider Hamdo's death. In the story, Hamdo is presented as a weak and
paranoid dictator. His death might be fair judgment on his actions.
Imagine, if Lala made Hamdo crazy or was the reason? What if Hamdo was
a great and benevolent dictator, broken by time and circumstance? If
the backstory existed, would it change your personal judgment?
Concrete examples are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Geass">Lelouch from Code Geass</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puella_Magi_Madoka_Magica">Homura from Puella
Magi Madoka Magica</a> if my example is lacking.
</p>

<p>
By ignoring the backstory, the characters can only be judged within
the context of the story. <b>It is their current actions that will define
them</b>, not by how justifiable and tragic their past stories are. This
idea is exemplified in the child soldiers. Aside from Shu, Nabuca and
Tabool, Boo is the other soldier who appears neutral, not unchanged,
by the situation. We cannot say if his hands are dirty without past
information, but within the story he is good, further amplified when he
takes a bullet for Nabuca. A backstory exists within the story but not
enough to completely paint them.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/now-and-then-here-and-there--boo-death.png" alt="Screenshot Of Boo's Death"/>
</p>

<p>
The lack of backstory is asking us to make a fair judgment, but what
are we to judge? Humanity? Our characters are forced into this
situation, we should not care who they were, but who they are now. We
are to judge the effect of war on their character.
</p>

<p>
In the first place, why should people stay true in dire times
specially for children placed in the horrors of war? Even without the
backstory, we can empathize how broken they are by their situation. To
dig deeper, we explore the mysterious character of Lala Ru.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf85c155" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf85c155">Lala Ru</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf85c155">
<p>
<i><b>Because ten billion years' time is so fragile, so ephermal&#x2026;</b></i>
<i><b>it arouses such a bittersweet, almost heartbreaking fondness</b></i>
</p>

<p>
Lala, the main heroine, is passive, not incapable. She has the power
of water although at the cost of using her life force. Why does she
allow people to use or abuse her?
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/now-and-then-here-and-there--lala-abuse.png" alt="Screenshot Of Hamdo Abusing Lala"/>
</p>

<p>
With her powers, Lala shares to Shu that she had been kind but has
been neglected and hunted. She believed she was doing good but it
brought more danger and chaos, thus she does not waste it for
humanity. This somewhat explains why she shows passivity or disdain
instead of force or power when threatened. If she tried to resist, she
would use her life force; after many times, silence seems to be louder.
</p>

<p>
Going back, Shu responds that her power is ultimately for good and
good people still exist, such as himself and motherly Sis. What this
tells us that Lala has lost hope as with Sara. Based on the previous
ideas, Lala is not allowed to return home by the story. Strange
enough, where is her home? Where will she return to?
</p>

<p>
If Lala's power is water and it depends on her life force, is Lala the
sea that fills the barren wasteland with life? Should Lala return to
the earth or ether?
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/now-and-then-here-and-there--the-rainbow.png" alt="Screenshot Of The Rainbow"/>
</p>

<p>
This is speculation why Lala disappears in the end that conveniently
ties into the ideas presented. The question still remains to where
Lala should return. If she lives, does she go with Shu, stay with Sara
or something else entirely? Lala is mysterious and ethereal enough
that believing she is a magical being is not far off. The opening
remark can be a hint.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/now-and-then-here-and-there--opening-remark.png" alt="Screenshot Of The Opening Remark"/>
</p>

<p>
Based on this, the other world might be set in a post-apocalyptic
future, not necessarily the same timeline as the original world. This
might roughly indicate Lala's age that implies her home is somewhat
timeless. What is fascinating about ten billion years is that the sun
may roughly die at the time. It implies not just the sun, but humanity
and life itself.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/now-and-then-here-and-there--sunset-reminder.png" alt="Screenshot Of Sunrise"/>
</p>

<p>
This somewhat explains her fascination with sunsets, not sunrises. If
I were her that lost hope, I want to wait for the sun to close my eyes
and make my bed. If Lala is practically immortal, a dying light is a
consoling and understanding friend. In comparison, she may not be like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Geass">C.C. from Code Geass</a>, but both share the isolation and burden of their
powers.
</p>

<p>
Sadly, connecting the opening remarks with Lala is flimsy since no
text supports it but it does set a tone for which we can read from. It
would have helped connect the dots if someone described the world even
for just a minute. What we do now that Lala has lived for thousands of
years and much of our reasoning somewhat holds.
</p>

<p>
Without a defined home, she breaks the idea or need to return home,
thus she is the exception. Instead, notice her final act is of
sacrifice. By using her power to sink the flying fortress knowing the
drawback and reason, she shows her restored faith and hope in
humanity. Phrased differently, <b>Lala was looking for hope.</b>
</p>

<p>
Urged by both the goodness of Shu and Sis, Lala shows both hope and
action. It is strange that Lala has not met good people for her to
have this problem but this is a backstory in itself. What is the story
asking by making the protagonist save her? This leads us to explore
what hope is in exploring the message.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgeb34acf" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgeb34acf">Hope and Optimism</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgeb34acf">
<p>
Another hard question, <b>what is hope?</b> Like with humanity, I can only
mean it here as quality of optimism or expectation for good things to
come. Instead, how does the series use the theme of hope or optimism?
Easily, Shu is the story's hope.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/now-and-then-here-and-there--hope.png" alt="Screenshot Of Shu's Hope"/>
</p>

<p>
Consider Nabuca and Tabool, Nabuca is doing all the atrocities
required of him so that he can go back home; however, Tabool has
abandoned the false hope and embraced the belief of being the
dictator. When Nabuca discovers that their village was scorched after
being taken, he puts his misplaced hope in Shu returning in his stead.
Nabuca's change comes from Shu unwavering humanity and disruption of
their ranks and becomes his hope in the end.
</p>

<p>
Consider Sara, she poses the most direct challenge to Shu. She was
taken, raped and soiled, how can she have hope in living in suffering?
This is in contrast with the child soldiers who creates suffering
instead of receiving. When Sara attempts to kill herself and by
extension her unborn child, it a powerful question to Shu's philosophy
of optimism and hope.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/now-and-then-here-and-there--sara-challenge.png" alt="Screenshot Of Sara's Attempted Abortion"/>
</p>

<p>
The hard thing to see here is that a child represents the hope of its
parents. Both Shu and Sis convince Sara to keep the child that
represents hope, not a burden or a taint. This answer affirms Shu and
the story.
</p>

<p>
Consider Abelia, the scene where he lets Hamdo die is her loss of hope
or faith in him. Why has she been faithful to him all this time, we
may never know. Looking closely, it is Abelia that gives Shu a chance
to survive by not killing him. She is averse to killing yet has to out
of orders. In the end, what is left for her but to find a new hope to
carry on.
</p>

<p>
Going back to Lala, she has lived for thousands of years and has lost
hope in humanity. Applying Shu's optimism to Lala's plight, Shu's
arrival is the hope or goodness her immortal life is anticipating. The
final conversation of Shu with Sara affirms this message of hope.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">SHU: Sara, you know, you once said I lied to you?
     Remember that?
     I still believe I was right.
     No matter where you are, whatever adversities you face,
     as long as you've got your life, something good is bound to happen.
     Something so totally awesome that would make up for al the bad
     stuff.
     Sure, it can get pretty tough in the meantime.
     I don't quite know hot to put it but... you know... um...
     Well, there you have it!
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In a way, Lala's disappearance makes sense when Shu's unwavering
humanity is put forward. Like with Nabuca, she is granted a meaningful
yet bittersweet death by completing her character arc.
</p>

<p>
A subtle inference with this idea is that if Lala cannot be judged by
changes in war, then was she the cause? Rather, is she the judge that
deserves an answer to the chaos of her existence? In a way, she is the
beginning and the end of the story and of the world. This is
speculation but an interesting guess that reminds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%8Ds%C5%8Dgiga">Lady Koto in
Kyousougiga</a> who causes the story by her love and existence.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org740afc5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org740afc5">Returning Home</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org740afc5">
<p>
Going back to the ending, we return to the original world with the
original question: what did change? Rather, <b>should anything change?</b>
Shu coming back from war without changing is clever. Soldiers
returning from war can develop <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder">posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</a> by
the experiences and hardships of war. Many films and games have
discussed this in greater detail such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambo_%28film_series%29">First Blood from Rambo series</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spec_Ops%3A_The_Line">Spec Ops: The Line</a> that I might not be fit to address. Regardless,
our protagonist does not develop this crippling disorder by virtue of
his unwavering humanity.
</p>

<p>
In the context of the disorder, it is good that Shu remained himself
despite his challenges. This ending cleverly undermines character
development in the context of tragedy or hardships. Simply, to not
change is better than to change for the worse. It is sad that nothing
is gained but be thankful nothing was lost that ties in the theme of
futility of war.
</p>

<p>
By virtue of Shu returning home, <b>the ending and story is telling us
to remain hopeful or true despite the lack of it.</b> You could claim
the final discussion was the message but we needed to understand why
this hopeful message was shadowed by a return to zero and what it
meant. For Nabuca or Sara, the return is not zero. As the viewer, are
we still here and there?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdfdd798" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgdfdd798">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdfdd798">
<p>
At last, I am at peace with this anime. I do admit that the backstory,
world building, character development, animation and portrayal of dark
themes might be lacking; however, the somber and sublime story it
tells towers over its faults. At the end, I felt I wanted to watch a
sunset with Lala Ru someday. Not of affection but of solace.
</p>
