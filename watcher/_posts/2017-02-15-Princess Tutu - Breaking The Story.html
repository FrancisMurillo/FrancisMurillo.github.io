<i><b>Princess Tutu disregards expectations to support the message</b></i>
</p>

<p>
After dropping <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Girl_Utena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casshern_Sins">Casshern Sins</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flowers_of_Evil_(manga)">Aku no
Hana</a>, I wanted to remind myself what a good anime is; this is where
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Tutu">Princess Tutu</a> comes in.
</p>

<p>
By presentation, it is a magical girl show like any other. The plot is
about a duck, a crow, a knight and a prince that appears to be a fairy
tale setting. Behind this cute facade presents the familiar yet
gripping question of free will and fate.
</p>

<p>
Aside from being a classical music lover, this anime appeals to me not
just on the subversive story but also the use of symphonies and play
with its story. Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Lie_in_April">Your Lie In April</a> where the music is not
strongly tied to the story (since you may change music playing with
dancing or sports or even swords), here it uses different operas and
ballets that tie into the episode theme, mood and story. A more
thorough musical analysis is out there but after hearing the sound
track and listening to a wide range of classics, the music is a true
variation on the existing piece that shows effort in the musical
department. I can't say more but I know it is impressive that it just
didn't edit the music straight from the public domain. I will say it
is a pleasure to watch and hear specially the opening theme, Morning
Grace, that sets the tone quite well.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, what I want to focus on is how framing and using the story as
a fairy tale supports the theme of fate and free will and not simply as
an aesthetic choice.

<h2 id="org9f6816d">The Story</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9f6816d">
<p>
Guessing the story from the clues, it is a love story between the duck
turned girl and the prince against the jealous crow princess that
takes its cue from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ugly_Duckling">The Ugly Duckling</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Lake">Swan Lake</a>. You don't need to
be familiar with them to understand the archetype or structure of a
romantic story like the enchanting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Good_articles">The Little Mermaid</a> or the
subversive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrek">Shrek</a> or the ever undying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet_(1968_film)">Romeo and Juliet</a>.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/princess-tutu--the-first-act.png" alt="Screenshot Of The First Act"/>
</p>

<p>
Let's first understand the overall story. This anime has twenty-six
episodes or two cours that represents the two acts, short of another
act to make it a three act play. The first act introduces us into the
story episodic proper while the other begins its heavy deviation.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org654355e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org654355e">The First Act</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org654355e">
<p>
In a nutshell, this act introduces us to the collection mission of
the duck, Ahiru, turned magical ballerina girl, Princess Tutu, into
gathering the lost pieces of the Prince's heart, Mytho, who cannot
feel any emotion. Unlike other collection structures where gathering
a key item has no bearing in a story or game such as the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda">The
Legend of Zelda</a>, retrieving a piece of the heart unlocks a new
emotion from the prince such as sorrow, love, fear and so on which
perturbes the peaceful relationships of the cast. The first half of
the anime does appear episodic that seems to culminate in the prince
recovering and unlocking his heart and his love for the swan
princess.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
The episodic structure is used to great effect here as it continually
hints at the overarching story of the anime itself: The Prince and
The Raven. It tells the story of a prince shattering his heart to
seal a dark Raven. Since our hapless protagonist is merely a duck,
she does not know that her mission ultimately brings the Raven back
into existence but the raven is not introduced within the fairy tale
first act. Rather, he is saved for the second act. After the first
act, a few more pieces of the heart remains, the sword of the prince
is broken and a Raven to slay.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
In short, the first half establishes the characters as well as subtly
and subvertly fulfilling the story of a fairy tale to break it apart
later with the tragic foreshadowing.
</p>

<h3 id="org6c7c7c2">The Second Act</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6c7c7c2">
<p>
The story of the second act is where the story and more importantly
the characters moves it beyond a magical girl anime to a great one.
The story drops the episodic structure as it moves to a more
character-driven story. It begins with the Prince turning into the
love hungry raven by a devious ploy of the Raven in enchanting or
cursing the fragment of love with his blood making friend turn foe.
On the other hand, the black swan is presented as a mere victim or
puppet to this malevolent being and is show greater depth along with
Fakir within the second act. The pretense of a fairy tale is replaced
by messing with every character, including the side ones.
</p>

</p>

<p>
The story of the second act is fighting the fate of the book itself,
that is cleverly setup in the first act. Rather, the greater fight
is with the narrator, Drosselmeyer, who has orchestrated everything
and is leading everyone to a tragic ending where the prince has to
shatter his heart again and reset the story instead of concluding it
with a happy ending. Defeating both the story villain and the story
teller is a story in itself.
</p>

<p>
The overall theme of the anime is defying fate that we link with
the characters.

<p>
At first glance of this anime, I thought it is just another
magical girl show. What let me push through despite the quacky
animation, cliched use of the Nutcracker Suite is how strange the
characters are setup in the beginning:
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/princess-tutu--quacky-animation.png" alt="Screenshot Of Quacky Animation"/>
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><b>The Prince without emotions</b></dt><dd>Without it, it is just cliched amnesia. What is weird is that he
is being saved and not the other way around. He is a bland
character by default since he has no emotion that is a play on
the main hero cliche itself.</dd>
<dt><b>The considerate Rival</b></dt><dd>Antagonist are almost evil by default; Rue is a better rival as
she merely loves the Prince and not a jerk to Ahiru that rich
girls or rivals are commonly portrayed.</dd>
<dt><b>The overprotective Knight</b></dt><dd>Fakir is not a romantic interest yet shows strong protective
feelings for the Prince. This is a play on the sidekick
where the trait should have gone to the love rival to make it
cliche. In a sentence, he is making sure his hero-complex
brother doesn't kill himself by constraining him, brotherly love
indeed.</dd>
<dt><b>The story teller</b></dt><dd>Why is there a separate narrator character? Rather, why is the
narrator making plays instead of simply narrating?</dd>
</dl>

<p>
I like all the main characters as each do not offend me but I have a
soft spot for the loveable Ahiru, the complicated Fakir and the wise
puppet Edel. The characters are already nuanced in the beginning yet
appearing stereotypical although I understand that they might turn
people off initially if the subversion is not seen and find bland and
generic characters instead.
</p>

<p>
Instead of describing each character in detail, the ending itself
encapsulate everything: <b>the Rival gets the Prince.</b>
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/princess-tutu--not-the-happy-ending.png" alt="Screenshot Of The Actual Ending"/>
</p>

<p>
The ending itself defies the fate of the book. The Rival has true
feelings of love for the Prince yet the Princess just admires him. At
the end, Fakir becomes a writer who counters the influence of
Drosselmeyer yet Ahiru is the same old duck who does not hook up at
the end. The mold is broken for every character and stereotype once
the end is reached although the ending is slightly rushed in certain
aspects.
</p>

<p>
The anime presents a good job with the theme and message and it should
be obvious why the anime is correct in framing the story within a
story.
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="org831ce5e">The Active Story Teller</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org831ce5e">
<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/princess-tutu--another-story.png" alt="Screenshot Of Breaking The Fourth Wall"/>
</p>

<p>
At the end of the anime, the Story Teller breaks the fourth wall by
acknowledging that the story is over and instead goes to another more
interesting one. This meta awareness adds to the theme of defying what
is written for the characters and the story itself.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/princess-tutu--the-wall.png" alt="Screenshot Of The Wall"/>
</p>

<p>
Interestingly, the town itself is part of the story since it is walled
off and nobody gets out including Princess Tutu, adding to the
disempowering fate their tragedy holds. If this meta layer is removed,
Drosselmeyer existence and interference is out of place; rather, he
becomes a Joker or Deus Ex character providing random story
progression with little reason or rhyme.
</p>

<p>
If the book was the sole foreshadowing element, defying fate is a
consequence of the characters will and not of the story itself. For
example, stories commonly have a prophecy, a legend or internal story
that foreshadows the journey or adventure that the characters
ultimately ignore and defy. By cleverly using a meta-story, it also
defies how the story should even playout or be. For example, even
after changing the fate, the characters themselves fall into the
archetype of their fate such as the heroine and hero hooking up. Here,
the story is a character itself who breaks the mold along with the
characters it plays on.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/princess-tutu--the-peaceful-ending.png" alt="Screenshot Of The Peaceful Ending"/>
</p>

<p>
By making the narrator an active participant in the story, he is
presented with the same question of fate and obedience. Should he make
a typical fairy tale story or an captivating tragedy? Since he chooses
to make it exciting, he effectively defies his fate and of the story
by exercising his choice. Talking about the meta story gets messy but
this is why the use of the narrator and fourth wall cleverly adds
layer and depth to this story structure. It supports the question of
free will, fate and obedience in such a stronger way.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/princess-tutu--drosselmeyer.png" alt="Screenshot Of Drosselmeyer"/>
</p>

<p>
This breaking of the story also creates a story in itself that is
ironic for what it is trying to do. Still, it shows that the story is
secondary to the characters will and desire, not of the audience or
narrator. If this is to be taken as the meta message, then write the
story from the characters and not the characters from the story. This
is Drosselmeyer's mistake when he focused on the tragedy and not how
the characters change or alter the story.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, stories are about the actors.

<h2 id="org0dcdd22">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0dcdd22">
<p>
To wrap up, using the story within a story mechanic for this anime
enriches the question of fate and not merely aesthetic. I deeply
appreciate this anime for not being a simple magical girl series. To
understand why I enjoy this, here are the things I find cliched about
magical girl series:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><b>Long and extraneous transformation</b></dt><dd>Utena and Sailor Moon in particular where the transformation
seems to pad out the run time after seeing it once. At least have
the decency of being short as not to take time.</dd>
<dt><b>Shoddy outfits</b></dt><dd>The usual magical girl outfit is to sell merchandise and appeal
to demographics. Although Princess Tutu is effectively wearing a
skirt, it is presented as wholesome and innocent.</dd>
<dt><b>Too colorful</b></dt><dd>The color is too bright and colorful in a way to simply
differentiate them as with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Rangers">Power Rangers</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Cure">Pretty
Cure</a>. Having a toned down color range for Princess
Tutu is such a breath of fresh air.</dd>
<dt><b>Heavily Stereotyped</b></dt><dd>Characters are heavily leaning on their personal quirks instead
of being more balanced out of plot contrivances</dd>
<dt><b>Cheesy Romance</b></dt><dd>Although I don't lean toward romantic stories, I just dislike it
if the romance is more about the feeling of love instead of the
weight and value of their relationship.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
I guess I am jaded with girly shows not having more depth or being
more cute or marketable but this anime is my exception and
recommendation in  many ways despite the flaws. (I have seen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puella_Magi_Madoka_Magica">Puella
Magi Madoka Magica</a> which some depth but I prefer the overall meaning
and package of this anime.)
