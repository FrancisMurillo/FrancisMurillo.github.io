<a href="https://neocabgame.com/">Neo Cab</a> is primarily a visual novel set in a dystopia for taxi drivers
similar to <a href="http://glitchhikers.com/">Glitchhikers</a> or <a href="https://waifubartending.com/">VA-11 HALL-A</a>. The game is about <i>Lina</i>, a
taxi cab driver, who is moving to <i>Los Ojos</i>, a town with self-driving
cars, with her best friend <i>Lina</i> to establish a fresh start. With its
aesthetic, cyberpunk vibe and possible thematic depth, I was interested.
After seeing a playthrough and all the possible endings, I was confused
and disappointed at the direction it took although I did find it
interesting and worth discussing. Still, it is a good game with the
stories of their passengers and evoking the feeling of economic
desperation like with <a href="https://www.papersplea.se/">Paper's Please</a>.

Automation has created a fear of replacing jobs and in this game world,
cars are self-driven with AI and taxi drivers are threatened. While I am
against self-driving cars that do not have accountability in mind, it
does not delve into deeper issues such as whether self-driving cars
protect their passengers more so than the pedestrians. (Check out <a href="http://moralmachine.mit.edu/">Moral
Machine</a> to understand these problematic scenarios.) Ethics aside, the
game does not show what benefits those self-driving cars have like
consistency, scalability and so on to balance the perspectives. One
peeve I have with cyberpunk is that technology and monopolies are
painted evil without mentioning positive impact. Usually we take the
perspective and morality of our protagonist, since <i>Capra</i>, the company
of self-driving cars, replaced our human driver, the protagonist thus
the player shares this animosity. Sadly, the game is intent in
demonizing <i>Capra</i> as an evil monopoly which I found cliche. As a
supporting idea, the currency used in the game, the car recharge
stations and several living home rentals our protagonist uses to survive
are made by that same company that indicates almost a staggering
monopoly over basic services and people. On the other hand, the activist
group, <i>Radix</i>, that hates cars (self-driven or human) or why subways or
trains are no longer viable transportation are not explained well or
clearly. Both findings show weak writing in coloring the cyberpunk
setting nuanced or interesting. If the world building is not the focus,
then what does the mechanic have to say?

As a taxi driver, the player can choose what passenger to serve based on
destination, fuel/electric consumption, ratings and revenue. Aside from
just financial survival, the rating system is the most interesting
aspect, thematically and narratively. For each passenger you serve, the
passenger gives the driver a star-based rating which is then averaged to
produce a driver rating. The catch is that if the rating of the driver
is below 4, the driver can be deactivated or decommissioned making your
interactions with difficult passengers a balance between being a friend
or a driver. This also affects how the player chooses passengers if the
rating is in danger that objectifies passengers as ratings. I also like
how regulars or frequent passengers that likes the driver can give a
3-star rating making them unreliable for ratings and how it talks about
impartiality in providing a basic service. Giving the ratings a
mechanical meaning and combined with the economic hardship of getting by
is a bright spot for this game that made me empathize with the character
and think about the ethical value of an averaged number.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Fundamentally, this is just the mechanical tension but the main tension
comes from how the stories of the passengers and the mystery of <i>Savy</i>'s
disappearance. Mechanically, this is more logistics planning than being
a taxi driver which is fine to support the story its trying to tell.
During the playthrough, one scenario had the driver picking up a
passenger in an invalid area for the ratings that could result in a
steep fine or penalty, another had the driver deciding to donate money
to a passenger who lost their lodging which are interesting ideas and
appreciate more of this. With those scenarios, several simple ideas can
further improve the immersion:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><b><b>Going against the navigator</b></b></dt><dd>Is there difference between a driver guided by an AI or an AI
driving the car itself? Perhaps, showing how human intuition and
perception go beyond path finding such as traffic and rerouting.</dd>
<dt><b><b>Crime or hostile passengers</b></b></dt><dd>One case of self-driven cars it that it also prevents the driver
from being harassed and taken advantage of. For example, a
passenger showing how mugging works even with a digital wallet.</dd>
<dt><b><b>Being a passenger</b></b></dt><dd>In games like this, the role of client and server can be reversed
for one scenario to muse on the</dd>
<dt><b><b>Route/street selection</b></b></dt><dd>Giving the player to select routes during rides that can affect
time and energy efficiency.</dd>
<dt><b><b>Timers</b></b></dt><dd>Certain decisions are timed say avoiding riots or conflicting
decisions with the police</dd>
<dt><b><b>Walking or being a commuter</b></b></dt><dd>Allow our protagonist to take walks or be as a commuter say while
investigating <i>Savy</i> in between shifts.</dd>
<dt><b><b>Multiple Dialogue</b></b></dt><dd>Showing a dialogue choice while the passenger is speaking can
convey the multi-tasking effort required to talk and drive.</dd>
</dl>

</p>

<p>
As it stands, the main map shows the majority of the mechanics and could
be thought of as rather generic. Taking cues from various visual novels
such as from <a href="https://telltale.com/">Telltale Games</a>, these ideas can be simply extra dialogue
choices, an in-game map and so on all to make the mechanical choices
more immersive or color the cyberpunk theme. So although we have a
serviceable mechanic to tell a story, I think the mechanics of <i>Neo Cab</i>
can be better and further developed to better express the theme or
message specially with it starting strong with the rating mechanics.
</p>

<p>
With both the world and mechanics not as strong or focus, does the story carry
the game?

<img src="/watcher/images/neo-cab--color-psychology.png" alt="Screenshot of FeelGrid"/>
</p>

<p>
Moving on to a strange narrative mechanic is the emotion wheel taken
from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_psychology">color psychology</a> that takes the form of a <a href="https://youtu.be/MKqHTCtr0Bo">glorified mood bracelet</a>.
Personally, I would not like accessories to show my private and internal
emotion to people without my consent. In this game, it is both a HUD
element and physical device that the passengers can read and comment on.
The twist is that based on how intense the current emotion is other
dialogue options are disabled. The most perceivable consequence of this
is to disable dialogue choices that may impact the ability to get a good
rating with passengers. As a minor gripe, it is unpredictable during
conversations is unpredictable so mechanics to manipulate it like an
option to take deep breathes would make it more interesting and
introspective.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/neo-cab--depression-quest.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Depression Quest"/>
</p>

<p>
More importantly, this is similar to <a href="http://www.depressionquest.com/">Depression Quest</a> where the level of
depression disabled valid and good options to represent how depression
prevents people from making the best decisions. In this game, it is used
to show our protagonist unable to fight back against her abuser, <i>Savy</i>.
The climax of the game is when you decrypt the incriminating data
against <i>Capra</i> and have a verbal boss fight with <i>Savy</i> to who should
deliver it and gain the glory in her eyes. A small peeve I have here is
that the <i>FeelGrid</i> on <i>Savy</i>'s neck serves as an indicator from green
to red showing her health making the whole aspect of standing up to her
a little immersion shattering, reading on verbal cues and intensity of
the attacks instead might be better. Nonetheless, the evidence of <i>Savy</i>
being a manipulative abuser is staggering:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b><b>Tracking you during the whole game, knowing you need help</b></b></li>
<li><b><b>Using you as a courier of dangerous data without your consent</b></b></li>
<li><b><b>Leaving you on an unfamiliar town without lodging or cash</b></b></li>
<li><b><b>Ignoring questions and forcing you to prioritize her</b></b></li>
</ul>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/neo-cab--savy.png" alt="Screenshot of Savy"/>
</p>

<p>
One minor parallel between <i>Capra</i> and <i>Savy</i> is how they represent a
form of control over the city and the player respectively. If <i>Savy</i>
wins the fight, <i>Capra</i> remains in control and <i>Savy</i> sells out <i>Radix</i>
and leaves with you; if <i>Lina</i> or the player wins, she leaves <i>Savy</i>,
may or may not take down <i>Capra</i> with the data, and leave the town with
another passenger. Either way, the framing whether to take <i>Capra</i> down
as a function to spite <i>Savy</i> is where I find the cyberpunk setting
displaced in the background. It is not about the ethical, moral,
practical or philosophical considerations of bringing down the
monolithic company and its technological progress, it is about dealing
with this relationship.
</p>

<p>
If the cyberpunk and dystopian setting is secondary, it might as well
have taken place in America during the prohibition as a struggling taxi
driver trying to make ends meet by smuggling alcohol while being
pressured by an abusive partner or family member. Also, it would not
focus on dismantling a government or institution but its effects and how
different forms of manipulation occur under various pressures. If <i>Neo
Cab</i>'s focus was indeed on <i>Savy</i>, then it would be better to drop the
<i>Capra</i> corporation and self-driving controversy and focus living under
the thumb of an abuser that might make it more coherent and focused.
Although I cannot speak for every possible passenger and dialogue that
shapes the story or world or whether the portrayal is respectful, the
general feel of the story does not have much of an impact.
</p>

<p>
Aside from the emotion intensity mechanic being more of a hindrance and
the story underwhelming, what else can we look to?
</p>

<h2 id="org93fe634">Final Comparison</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org93fe634">
<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/neo-cab--eliza.png" alt="Screenshot of Eliza"/>
</p>

<p>
To compare against another visual novel with a stronger impact, <a href="http://www.zachtronics.com/eliza/">Eliza</a> is
about a programmer who worked on a psychologist AI leaving the industry
in bad terms for three years and coming back to see what happened to her
project, its impact and whether it actually helps people. The central
mechanic is being a human proxy for that AI and merely parroting a
script or responses to the patient. This made me quit a day after
initial session because of the depressing implications. Pushing through
the game, the topics are also shallowly discussed but it works here
because it does not judge the player's choice and must decided between
the push and pull of the issues. The choice that determines the ending
is much more satisfyingly agonizing, meaningful and thematically
satisfying.
</p>

<p>
As a minor spoiler, one choice had you returning to your old job to grow
the AI. The pull for me is that my baby project is possibly being
misused and mishandled that I would rather go back to protect the legacy
of the old team, while the push is that the AI is not fit for actually
addressing mental issues where a human therapist might be better. The
president of the company is a typical business man who treats him
employees like a tool; however, he considers himself a tool or servant
for change and would prefer to be in the company that produces the
singularity. His goal is not money but that humanity can transition to a
higher intelligence or evolution through the singularity and that AI is
the seed that he wants to grow regardless of more ethical concerns about
big data and privacy. As much as I disagree working for an unethical
person, the game was able to make me reconsider my position along with
the other choices.
</p>

<p>
As simple this game is as a visual novel, I would prefer to play this
again for its subtlety and balance. Even if it did not dive deep in
philosophy or morality, it did make me think about those questions hours
after the credits and that is a success in my book. Regardless of my
rambling about themes and meanings, comparing this against <i>Neo Cab</i> or
simply on its own, the story and emotions did not stay past the credits.
Nonetheless, I am still open for a sequel or variation of the game as
long as it provides a more meaningful experience or insight into the
fears of automation from the eyes of the working class.
