<h2 id="org87a025b">Aurora (2018)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org87a025b">
<p>
I recently watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(2018_film)">Aurora (2018)</a> and wrote a <a href="https://www.fandango.com/aurora-2019-215725/movie-reviews">random thought post</a>. I
want to expand my thoughts here formally. Aside from its premise of a
crashed ship haunting the horizon, it is interesting that <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/asia/netflix-buys-philippines-horror-film-aurora-yam-laranas-1203179315/">Netflix</a>
picked this film for their catalog as with <a href="https://2ndopinion.ph/birdshot-netflix/">Bird Shot (2016)</a> which is a
good sign that Philippine cinema is getting better. In the
Philippines, I am seeing less romantic comedies and more intimate
romance and social commentary films focusing on cinematography and
character which is a good sign.
</p>

<p>
Although this film has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Metro_Manila_Film_Festival">won awards</a>, I find the film lacking polish in
its CGI, cinematography and meaning. However, I saw a two ideas in its
story that could be better explored that could make it a better film.
For this article, I expect you to have seen the film, so I won't be
writing a story summary like I usually do, so I can focus on those
points instead.

This is an optional section to briefly mention some issues or nitpicks
I had with the film that hopefully the ideas can cover.

<h3 id="org3b023a3">Opening Shot</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3b023a3">
<p>
The opening shot of the sea to the house seems to be a lost
opportunity. It might be trying to raise suspense or setup mood but
it doesn't do much sadly.

<h3 id="orgd27b126">Ship</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd27b126">
<p>
When I saw the crashed ship in the distance, I was hooked with the
possibility of a haunting memory or tragedy that should never be
forgotten. I was expecting a mystery/investigation of the ship and
human error led to its tragedy. That tragedies, for all of its
miseries, teach us collectively to be wiser and more acute to human
consequences. The problem lies in the ship disappearing in the end
conflicts with that. By disappearing, it could mean we have forgiven
or forgeten the tragedy which is worse even if it a quasi-closure to
the story. They didn't have to equate the ship with any imagery or
symbolism but it is a missed opportunity.

<h3 id="orgee3aca3">Ghost Giant</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgee3aca3">
<p>
Regarding the ship's demise, the film used ghosts as an explanation.
The ship crashed not because it was mainly overloading passengers
that a giant ghost manipulated the captain to crash the ship instead.
Physics aside, I was disappointed they used this as the driving
cause. The cause is not of human error but of paranormal in nature
which cannot be held responsible for the ship's malpractice. Of
course, the giant's aggression was raised because he was made a
sideshow by the passengers themselves which is still a human cause
but not a strong one.

<h3 id="orge0c5661">Character and Motivation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge0c5661">
<p>
For our protagonist, staying to keep the place afloat by finding dead
bodies is hard to understand without context or development. Being
duty-bound to a promise or commitment does not explain anything
either. Even if she succeeds in keeping the place alive, the place is
considered haunted or dangerous making it nearly impossible to
sustain. To say plainly, I don't think the protagonist is
characterized properly or her motivation clearly justified.

<h3 id="org1ed1872">Ending Scene</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1ed1872">
<p>
After the ship disappears near the end, the protagonisth meet a group
of people and the coast guard, she then mentions the coast guard's
search did not include various areas in the ship alluding to a
coverup. Not only is this rushed, it is a cliche to quickly wrap the
story quickly without buildup or momentum.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org73ebf91" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org73ebf91">Overloading</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org73ebf91">
<p>
The first point relates to a practice tolerated in the Philippines. In
the Philippines, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeepney">Jeepneys</a> are a public mini bus-like transportation
which came from a surplus of jeeps at the end of World War 2. Since
the Philippines is a third world country and with rising international
gas prices, <a href="https://www.tyremarket.com/tyremantra/vehicle-overloading-road-accidents/">overloading jeepneys</a> to maximize value is culturally
accepted although discouraged practice. Although not a strong social
issue, it has caused issue and concern about safety at scale.
Airplanes cannot overload their planes as a standard since a crash or
malpractice causes a costly scandal for everyone. If overloading was
the root issue why the ship crashed, it might have been more
believable and might have raised awareness.
</p>

<p>
Imagine this scenario: the ship is packed with passengers that crew
and personel are understaffed and unable to monitor and handle events
or accidents. During a stormy night, all passengers are moved inside
for shelter and ship becomes cramp and hot as more come in. The crew
is pestered with requests from parents to ease their family from the
heat and noise. Eventually something happens, the ship's unbalanced
weight caused of the motors to snap past the breaking point causing a
fire or tilting the ship even further. People try to respond but the
halls are packed and blocked. One led to the other, generators lose
capacity, steering fails, lights go dark, dread and panic settle in,
people scrambling for comfort. This all too much even for the captain
that they fail to realize and prevent their imminent crash amidst the
storm. Then a massive thud.
</p>

<p>
The scenario or cause is not exact since the ship contingencies might
address them. The idea is that when a ship is overloading and an
accident occurs, the crew could not effectively handle it otherwise.
To maximize profit at the cost of safety, a good theme for a film. If
we do that, we can put a scene where our protagonist is riding an
overloaded jeepney that breaks down and creates a road block to hint
at it.
</p>

<p>
To further link the tragedy to the families, we use the ghost's
connection. Instead of a survivor from the ship, we can have the
ghosts reveal the story inside the ship and their families. Imagine
one more scenario: during another stormy night, our protagonist wakes
to a tapping at her door. Behind it is a ghastly child leading her
down the living room where other are waiting and chanting <i>"Tulungan
mo kami. (Help us.)"</i>. Our protagonist cries in exhaustion <i>"Paano?
(How?)"</i>. With the chanting getting louder, the ghosts circle around
her with their hands reaching out to her slowly covering her and the
screen. The next scenes show her inside the ship before the calamity
like flashbacks and visions. Within that scene, she is shown where
several family members live. Since this is the time before the
internet or social media, she finds each of the concerned relatives
such as grandparents or relatives to tell them what really happened.
Another investigation is raised that shows many of the concerned
passengers are not in the manifest that makes it into national
television bringing the incident to public awareness.
</p>

<p>
With that scenario near the ending, we can remove the awkward ending
of people suddenly appearing for the exposition dump. Of course, this
scenario might be optimistic or unrealistic and might not change any
regulation in the film's world but if done well might discourage
people from taking the overloaded option when offered. Nonetheless,
this address the cause which I had a problem and focuses more on the
human angle.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org82d89c6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org82d89c6">Leaving</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org82d89c6">
<p>
The other point can be considered a continuation of the previous
point but can standalone. When the protagonist visited town and
learned businesses are closing down, it reminded me of <a href="http://www.nightinthewoods.com/">Night in the
Woods</a> where the town's economic concerns tied with the protagonist's
personal conflict. Minor thematic spoiler, the protagonist was trying
to hold on to a past of a dying town and chooses to remain there till
the end. We can focus on the theme of leaving things behind.
Afterwards, we can explore and show the significance family business
but declining or dying persuading them to sell or leave the place
after the ghost business.
</p>

<p>
Another key idea I found interesting to explore is that the sea
outside the home has become a graveyard since the coast guard could
not find the rest of them. <b>Sea of the dead</b>, a graveyard outside.
Imagine this scenario: during the film, corpses eventually wash
onshore. The protagonist team is first disgusted but bury the body
later and cash a guilty check. Another is found, again and again,
making it emotionally and morally harder each time. The beach is
slowly buried in stone. Eventually causing the ghosts to seek help
from our protagonist tying the flashback scenario in the ship.
</p>

<p>
It might fit the theme of waiting much better than searching and
finding one or none. By waiting instead, the scene where the
protagonist rethinks her action when they start looting the ship's
trash can be removed in favor of letting the ghosts slowly reveal
themselves to her while having the option for that horror aesthetic.
Likewise, discovering the overloading issue comes from the ghosts
themselves and confirmed by the friend afterwards is more natural
than an information dump from her friend. Lastly, profitting from the
dead to keep the business afloat is a cause similar to the ship and
by leaving it behind is to hope for a better environment and freedom
from the compromises made. When they do decide to leave and the talk
to the families, the ship can slowly sink in the distance or be
scrapped over time than simply vanishing overnight.
</p>

<p>
To make the motivation stronger, we make a passenger a relative of
the house such as a grandparent or brother to reconsider the selling
or leaving out of respect or memories. If we make the house represent
trauma such as memories of isolation, longing, depression or the
like, it can add more pressure to let go and move on while developing
the character. Also, a fragment of trauma still remains even after
moving on from it; like with history, the ship may no longer cover
the horizon but its story of tragedy will remain. Making the ship and
the house represent an external and internal conflict might make for
a better character arc for our protagonist.

<h2 id="org4201049">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4201049">
<p>
Those two ideas together, <a href="#org82d89c6">Leaving</a> and <a href="#org73ebf91">Overloading</a>, have a great
thematic potential if focused or developed. A cautionary story of
personal and financial greed and of letting go with a taste of mystery
and horror. Nonetheless, as long as the Philippine cinema finds more
variety and taste, the industry is moving on as well.
