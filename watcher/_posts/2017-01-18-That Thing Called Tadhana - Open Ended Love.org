* Open Ended Endings

  /*That Thing Called Tadhana uses its ending to undermine its*/
  /*question and journey.*/

  Open ended endings are endings that leaves the resolution to the
  audience. Or it can be a sequel-bait or cop-out depending on how it is
  executed. If the ending answers the message, what happens to the
  message when then ending is open? The simple answer is that the
  message has no easy answer, that it cannot be just a yes or no. This
  kind of ending wants to you to think about the message more than it
  wants it answered which is why I have a soft spot for it when done
  correctly.

  I don't have high expectations for Tagalog movies since it is
  populated with low brow romantic comedies. If I hear someone say
  "pangmasa" again as an excuse for lack of quality, I will glare at
  that person. Once in a while, there is a rare gem of a film that I can
  be proud of being a Philippine movie goer. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Thing_Called_Tadhana][That Thing Called Tadhana
  (2014)]] is that rare gem despite appearing to be a romantic comedy.

  At face value with the title and [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvLVWTaUT5w][trailer]], it looks like a romantic
  comedy that any genre savvy person would have seen more time than the
  number of seats in a theater. Skeptical as I am even with the
  accolades it has won, I approached this movie with apprehension and I
  was happy to be wrong. By a casual viewing, this movie is refreshing
  and down-to-earth which removed the need to break the mood with
  needless comedy. Where this shines for me is how it asks what love
  means in a relationship and how it executes its ending to support
  that.

  My focus will be on the main question it raises, the meaning of their
  shared trip and what the ending's answer is.

* A Question Of Love

  /*"If it's meant to be, it will be?*/
  /*If he's destined for you, he will come back to you?"*/

  /*"Bullcrap. That fucks you over."*/

  The film is thankfully very simple and straightforward, it is explicit
  with its symbols and is dialogue heavy; however, it has good
  cinematography, several long takes and revels in its quiet moments
  which is a rarity. Being genre savvy, it implies these two will move
  on and hook up by the end and the film will preach to move on with
  your life. By title alone the theme is if it is stupid to believe in
  romantic fate or "tadhana".

  With the same impression, the main question and the expectation of the
  journey are in conflict: the former suggest that each of them will go
  back since it is fate while the latter suggest that they move on and
  hook up. Experiencing a breakup leads to the question of believing in
  fate and as long as the question remains unresolved, so does the
  heartache linger. Do you believe in the one you love or move on?

  Typically, the endings gives the answer or which it sides but first
  let us take a look at the actors and what side they represent.

* The Journey

  In understanding the characters, let's see the mechanics in which they
  grow. Two well-adjusted people meet up accidentally while take a
  sight-seeing journey, what a simple way to express moving on from
  heartache. No concern of money and circumstance but of heartache and
  solace.

  [[img:watcher/images/that-thing-called-tadhana--looking-back-and-forward.png][Screenshot Of Where They Stand]]

  Let's take a look our characters from their heartache.

** The Girl

   [[img:watcher/images/that-thing-called-tadhana--mace.png][Screenshot Of Mace]]

   The woman who was left behind by his boyfriend for a better future in
   another country. Some time later, she decided to visit his boyfriend
   but only found him living with another woman. After that, she feels
   torn and carries the ache with her; but she still loves him despite
   being tired and hurt. She tried to fight but lost and now carries
   that pain.

   In the view of romantic fate, she believed and acted for her lover
   but wasn't reciprocated in the end.

** The Boy

   [[img:watcher/images/that-thing-called-tadhana--anthony.png][Screenshot Of Anthony]]

   The man who refused marriage and lost his girlfriend in the process.
   It his not that he didn't love his girlfriend but that his girlfriend
   demanded more responsibility and commitment which he could not give
   at the time. She left him but he did not chase her, letting fate
   decide if they are meant to be. Without action, he has moved on but
   still feels empty.

   Using the previous lens, his inaction shows belief in it because if
   she is his destiny then she will come back but is rebuked and
   suffering for his choice since he knows that she has settled down and
   has a family.

** The Heart And The Arrow

   [[img:watcher/images/that-thing-called-tadhana--the-heart-and-the-arrow.png][Screenshot Of The Heart And The Arrow]]

   The unfinished story of Mace about the heart and the arrow is
   representative of both the Mace and Anthony and their relationship.
   In this story, Mace is the heart while Anthony the arrow. According
   to it, the heart slid of the arrow because the arrow kept
   denying that was his; the lack of commitment from the arrow made the
   heart move on but the arrow still felt empty. Importantly, this
   analogy is foreshadowing the end of their journey.

   The film's lens indicates that both believed but acted differently
   thus symbolizing their stances.

** End Of The Road

   I can delve into how quaint and nice their journey is but it is the
   end of the pilgrimage that is most intriguing. When returning from
   their vacation, they find Mace's former lover at her doorstep wanting
   to get back to her which Anthony goes on ahead.

   [[img:watcher/images/that-thing-called-tadhana--the-end-of-the-tale.png][Screenshot Of The End]]

   This scene undermines the whole journey as well as magnify the
   positions the characters are. In one perspective, they are their
   former lovers where Anthony is the one who leaves and is never chased
   while Mace is the one found with another man and is being begged.
   Fulfilling their roles in the tale, the arrow when confronted denied
   staying with the heart and let her slip off once more.

   If you breakdown the action of each character, it means different for
   each of them and what the journey means. Anthony has first choice
   whether to fight for Mace or leave, it reflects his growth on the
   journey but is ultimately meaningless as he goes ahead. Next, Mace
   has a choice of asking Anthony to stay, it shows her acceptance in
   moving on but again denied. Lastly, Anthony has the final choice of
   fighting for Mace, which would indicate his commitment and love for
   her but instead gives way. At each step, there is a thematic
   significance and questioning of the message and journey itself.

* Ambiguity

  I liked it that Mace's former lover is not truly characterized. We do
  not know why he left her, we do not know the circumstance of him
  coming back, and we will never know his intentions; at the least, he
  has come back to fulfill fate or returning to the one you love. With
  this however, it seems to invalidate the growth of the journey.

  [[img:watcher/images/that-thing-called-tadhana--the-completed-tale.png][Screenshot Of The Completed Tale]]

  The final scene of the film has Anthony finish the incomplete story of
  Mace and decides to find her and fight for her once more which is both
  stereotypical and subversive in context. He fights for her after
  losing her which is indeed typical of a romantic comedy but the
  subversion here is we don't know what happened to Mace. It might be
  futile but he now plays the role of Mace in this regard, that their
  time together might afford one more chance. The film then leaves the
  audience with a shot of the completed book leaving us with an open
  ending.

  Here is where the tale takes a deeper meaning. Mace's unfinished tale
  is open-ended or without closure. Anthony giving it an ending and form
  is symbolic of the film itself. However, until he gives it to her, it
  is not complete which still leaves the events open as before. We don't
  know if this action is ultimately futile or romantic but isn't that
  what love is? Blind and stupid and also a dream.

  So in the end, what is the meaning of the ending being unresolved?

* Staying In Love

  Examining the theme of romantic fate. If you believe in romantic fate,
  you are positioned to have Mace in a relationship and Anthony fail in
  his endeavor. If you don't, you believe Mace will reject her former
  lover and accept Anthony in the ending. In either case, Mace's former
  lover symbolizes the goal of the journey; by rejecting him rejects the
  belief, but by accepting him rejects the journey.

  Despite these contradictions, neither is it wrong to believe in
  romantic fate nor fighting against it. Imagination and lust is what
  writes stories while strength and desire is why we fight against it.
  To accept and deny fate is both romantic. If the ending does choose a
  side, it denies one that makes romances very subtle and complex. Love
  is not a size fits all, sometimes letting things be and sometimes
  fighting are valid actions as shown by Mace. So by leaving the ending
  open, it neither denies itself at the same time the complexity of
  being stupidly in love. You know, you idiots.

  [[img:watcher/images/that-thing-called-tadhana--opening-lines.png][Screenshot Of The Opening Lines]]

  Moving on is not wrong but it shows how waiting and letting things
  boil is also an option. If Mace waited and never took the journey, she
  is justified in her belief and patient by letting her lover miss her;
  but the journey gave her strength while sleeping on it. Acting and
  waiting. This shows that neither belief is completely wrong and can
  coexist.

  That is also why this ending makes sense in context, because no one is
  ultimately wrong. One could take sides, find reason out who is more
  justified or discover interpretations but finding who is meant for
  each other is really the sentiment. I am not an expert in love, I
  merely understand the struggle presented by Mace and Anthony and I
  hope they find their destiny.

* Meta Conflict

  Let's look at the conflict in expectations with everything in mind.
  The showdown at the end is subverted by not being loud and dramatic.
  This scene typically ends up where the man pleads to the woman and
  getting back together; however, this scene is presented as a real
  issue for the main couple hooking up at the same time making their
  relationship secondary. At the same time, Anthony leaving subverts the
  typical need to fight during a conflict and show the woman his love;
  his leaving can be interpreted as allowing Mace to find closure which
  shows more concern for her than inaction while also fulfilling the
  failed scenario of a having a problem before truly hooking up. Lastly,
  showing they aren't together in the end is the most obvious subversion
  of a romantic film.

  This film is full of subverted expectations which doubles in showing
  how complicated the circumstances are for this film. Rejecting the
  expectations is rejecting the notion of being boxed in about romantic
  fate.

* Conclusion

  So the use of open-ended ending here explores romantic fate whereas
  the use of it in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Words][The Garden Of Words]] explores maturity in relationship
  and both films are stronger for doing so. That is why I have a soft
  spot for it, it doesn't need to answer itself but let the audience be
  immersed by the possibility and meaning. I recommend this film if not
  for the meaningful ending and subversion, but by the simple and
  reserved romance it presents.
