<i><b>The Wolf Among Us fails to establish its setting making the story</b></i>
<i><b>less plausible</b></i>
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wolf_Among_Us">The Wolf Amoung Us</a> is another good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telltale_Games">Telltale Game</a>, which I am a fan. I
say good but flawed. In particular, this game does not truly establish
it world to make the story believable. World building.
</p>

<p>
In world building, it is not the epic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls">Elder Scrolls</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings">The Lord of the
Rings</a> series nor is it from the strange mind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Oizo">Quentin Dupieux</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Winding_Refn">Nicholas Refn</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Aronofsky">Darren Aronofsky</a>. It does have a fascinating setup:
fairy tale characters escape and live in the real world. Strangely
familiar, this setup has already been done by a film including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith">Will
Smith</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Lee_Jones">Tommy Lee Jones</a>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_in_Black_(film)">Men In Black</a>. In a world where aliens are
living and disguised as humans, what would that look like?
</p>

<p>
How the game adapts fables instead of simply referencing them is
worthy of discussion. In the first place, why use an existing story
character and expectation as basis? With that in mind, consider its
use in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RWBY">RWBY</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin-Roh%3A_The_Wolf_Brigade">Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch-Drunk_Love">Punch-Drunk Love</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts">Kingdom
Hearts</a>. Ranging from being direct to sublime, expanding or using on
existing stories provide more material to work on.
</p>

<p>
A sad answer is bringing hype around the character as with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman">Batman</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman">Superman</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_v_Superman%3A_Dawn_of_Justice">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man">Iron Man</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America">Captain
America</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America:_Civil_War">Captain America: Civil War</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader">Darth Vader</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_One">Rogue One</a>
where the list would never end if I continue. It does help marketing
when big names or expectations are present. Reuse, reduce and recycle.
</p>

<p>
With these numerous references and scales, I believe this game does a
good job without being trapped in the fables. Despite having several
backstories and settings, it is not excused in establishing its own
setting. This article is not a rant but more of an analysis on how
important the setting is fundamental to the character's action within
the story.

<i><b>SPOILERS AHEAD</b></i>

<div id="outline-container-org65ef473" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org65ef473">Story Foundation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org65ef473">
<p>
The basic story is a murder mystery where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Red_Riding_Hood">Big Bad Wolf</a> is the
protagonist while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White">Snow White</a> is the lawful partner. This is not a film
noir but a story about the moral ambiguity and responsibility of being
a civil servant. In comparison, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(video_game)">The Walking Dead</a> also presents the
same theme and message but focuses more on the meaning and value of
paternity. Whereas the setting of that game is within a realistic
natural world, this game uses a fictional city and world that needs to
be explained to the audience.
</p>

<p>
This is a problem of using a fictional world: allocating time in
explaining the basics of the world. If done correctly and creatively,
it immerses the audience and opportunities in story telling. Phrases
such as "once upon a time" or "in a world where" is a testament of
this value. What explanation does the game owe us?
</p>

<p>
Starting with the mechanics, the crux of allowing mythical beings to
coexist with human beings is the disguise magic or item known as
<b>glamour</b>. This allows trolls, frogs and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast"> Beast</a> to walk with the crowd.
If mythical beings walk outside without disguise, it is breaking the
law in this town that our protagonist must apprehend.
</p>

<p>
What complicates this is that it is both expensive and a common good.
Imagine if electricity, water or taxes is more expensive then you
understand how poverty plays into our mythical beings pockets. If you
want to be an honest fable, you have to pay up. Aside from the typical
magic, this is the basic world building presented early on.
</p>

<p>
Everything else seems to be presented in a typical noir city with
basic services such as bars, taxis and clubs. It is a city that
appears fine on the outside where many stories are working on as in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter">Harry Potter</a>. By using this setting, it is assumed that usual physics
and logic is held in this universe. Normal unless stated otherwise.
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="org32759c4">Missing Points</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org32759c4">
<p>
The story already has several plot holes but I want to focus on how a
lack of world building undermines the story.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7016991" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7016991">Glamour</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7016991">
<p>
As basic as it is, it is not explained that well. The story fails to
answer these questions:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><b>How much is glamour?</b></dt><dd>In this fictional world, how expensive is it? How does it
compare with ordinary goods? The characters keep saying it is
expensive but it isn't shown or emphasized. Without basis or
comparison, it undermines its theme of poverty.</dd>
<dt><b>How long does it work?</b></dt><dd>Following up, how often does it need to be refreshed? Even if
characters stay indoors the whole time, it is required by law to
pay for it thus the question of frequency and duration should be
answered. Aside playing into the twist of the story, it
compounds with the previous question and theme as well as
playing into cheap and illegal quality glamour.</dd>
<dt><b>How does disguises work?</b></dt><dd>When using glamour, what disguise do you get? Can you switch
disguises after choosing? Rather, can you switch to the disguise
of others? This question plays into the early issue of Snow
being killed. If characters have no true face or identity, no
character can be thought as dead without checking for glamour
that many ending theories hinge on. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible">Mission Impossible</a> anyone?</dd>
</dl>

<p>
If glamour does plays into empathizing with their living condition,
then it deserves some attention and answer.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdb14364" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgdb14364">Fables</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdb14364">
<p>
The true actors and highlight of the story. As important they are,
they fail to answer these questions:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><b>Why are live in this town?</b></dt><dd>I do know it is answered by the opening narration and probably
answered within notes but not emphasized within the play itself.
If fables hate living there, why not go somewhere else or why
not go back? Rather, why not fight back? Rather, what I want the
game to go back to the fabled universe and show why going back
is not possible.</dd>
<dt><b>Can Fables die?</b></dt><dd>How are fables made? Are fables born and die every minute or are
fables fixed? What does it mean to kill a fable? During the
numerous action scene, how durable are they? The lack of
explanation undermine how those scenes are believable. All I see
is a bunch of quick time events, not a fight for life. Their
longevity is also in question when they have been doing their
job for hundreds of years. Do they even age if they are
immortal? The game does not explain the life cycle of a fable.</dd>
<dt><b>Why a fable goverment?</b></dt><dd>What does it mean to govern fables? Who or what decides who the
leaders are? If nobody wants the wolf to be sheriff, why is that
in the first place? Most of the cast whines so much where no
reason is truly given. Rather, did the wolf choose or not? The
game merely assumes a government without clear reason or
responsibility.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
These unanswered questions keep pestering the actions of the
characters. Why do our character do what they do if the setting they
are in has no reason?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgecc9dc1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgecc9dc1">Farm</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgecc9dc1">
<p>
The jail of the game where fables who break the law go. Here are some
questions about it:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><b>What id bad about it?</b></dt><dd>Is it really a bad place? The game merely says it is but not
shown. Isn't better to go there if free food and lodging is
waiting?</dd>
<dt><b>Why is there such a space?</b></dt><dd>If a place can be designated for fables, why are they stuck with
the responsibility of blending in? Rather, is this an
representation of immigrants? If so, the game does not show
choice.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
All I need is the story to visit this place to see if the farm is for
animals or fables. Without it, I see no reason having no glamour
would be unreasonable.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1645d3c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1645d3c">Bigby</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1645d3c">
<p>
The greatest offender is the protagonist himself. Another set of
questions:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><b>Why does he get a final form?</b></dt><dd>I understand glamour hiding the true form but our protagonist
whips out a final form that decimates the enemy out of nowhere.
Where was the foreshadowing?</dd>
<dt><b>How strong is he?</b></dt><dd>Whereas getting hit in a quick time event is enough to knock the
hero out. This is a problem with quick time events that is a
problem of having it in the first place.</dd>
<dt><b>Why silver?</b></dt><dd>Rather, how much canon are we taking? This reminds me more of
vampires mythos instead of red caped girls.</dd>
<dt><b>Why the wolf?</b></dt><dd>I believe this is part of its popularity and wolf-sheep related
jokes. Admittedly, choosing a role reversal for a victim-villain
story is a good choice; however, it implies the caped girl be a
villain in this story? In this world, she is dead, thus the
possibility is lost.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
I do not comprehend who our protagonist is and he is capable of. All
I see is a substitute film noir detective for the player, not a
fleshed out villain turned civil servant.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org19e1c0d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org19e1c0d">Missing Foundation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org19e1c0d">
<p>
Adding all the previous points, why adapt the characters if they are
not truly used? To be fair, the game does not assume you know the
myriad of tales to play which is acceptable; however, what is the
point if their baggage is not used neither is the world truly built
for them to live? The question is what does the setup truly achieve?
Instead, I opt for a sci-fi setting and little is lost. Think about it
if <span class="underline">Men in Black</span> can tell the same story if you make the protagonist
a wolf.
</p>

<p>
Nothing is wrong with using this style as with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel:_ultimate_alliance">Marvel: Ultimate
Alliance</a> yet it uses its characters more for their plot than just
references and indulges in using the quirks of the characters. In
comparison, this game is disappointing in both regards neither
fleshing out the existing story nor playing of their unique strengths.
As a singe adaption, I appreciate if it was more in the style of the
game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Path_(video_game)">The Path</a> or film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin-Roh%3A_The_Wolf_Brigade">Jin-Roh</a> where the fable is either the setting or
the theme.
</p>

<p>
If the setting is merely dressing, then it is a sheep in wolf's
clothing. If the story is about moral ambiguity, then how does
bringing immigrant fables support this. Is making stories irrelevant
talking about equality or identity in the face of moral choices? Is
making fables leave their homes talking about identity and fate
despite environment as with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoJack_Horseman">BoJack Horseman</a>? Such fascinating ideas or
questions that might be stretching it too far but the ideas for the
setup are there to reap.
</p>

<p>
I remain hopeful but I see no evidence where the setup is crucial to
the story. The game has to lose pacing and immersion if such questions
lose suspension of disbelief, for me quite frequently. Maybe, the use
of a fantasy noir style seems to be just an aesthetic. I adore the
style and nothing is wrong with just being slick; however, it feels
more hollow as a story. If it is style, then let is shine.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb1bf4d2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb1bf4d2">Plot Points</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb1bf4d2">
<p>
If you need more evidence, think about the following plot points if
the question about the setting were answered:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><b>Who is Nerissa?</b></dt><dd>If glamour was explained, how many theories about <b>Faith</b> can be
answered? I understand it emphasizes the moral ambiguity of
choosing to go after her but the choice comes out of left field
for the player who has to understand that Nerissa might be Faith
or someone else entirely. In short, I feel the twist is
unwarranted and complicates matters more than it has to.</dd>
<dt><b>Who is the Crooked Man?</b></dt><dd>Is he a fable? The witch during the trial hinted that he might
be. This is important to understand why the villain is the
villain. I understand he is from Mother Goose but no emphasis was
placed on his origin in to other fables. Empathy to his plight or
motive and empathy to his fellow fables would give the villain
more depth and nuance.</dd>
<dt><b>How much do fables know of other fables?</b></dt><dd>Do they all know each other and their stories? What is their
community? What is their web of relationship? This answers the
motive of each character as well as pacing. Everyone knows the
sheriff yet as if knows nobody and some form of introduction
slows the story down. Rather, the sheriff is not as sharp or
street smart which begs my faith.</dd>
<dt><b>What magic?</b></dt><dd>When the sheriff is caught by the human police, why is their
magic to wipe out memory like the flash? Wouldn't
that imply witness may be unreliable? What about
the magic mirror? Wouldn't that imply loss of
privacy? Rather, how much observation magic is
present in the first place? Does magic even cost
anything? How about the Crooked Man's door magic?
Why is he the only one employing such protective
magic? The use of magic feels more Deus Ex than
actual mechanics tied in the story. Without explaining it, it
feels more Deus Ex than an element of the setting.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
I don't need a full explanation but enough to keep my suspension of
disbelief. It just feels that the game could be written more tightly
and efficiently to make the story more believable.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge842421" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge842421">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge842421">
<p>
Again, I commend the game for its effort but its elements seem
superfluous to what story it is trying to say neither is it integral
to the game. I weakly recommend playing it but it is still fun as a
casual experience.
