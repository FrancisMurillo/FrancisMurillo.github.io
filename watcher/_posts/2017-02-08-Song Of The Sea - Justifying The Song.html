<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_of_the_Sea_%282014_film%29">Song of the Sea (2014)</a> is one of the best hand drawn film I have ever
seen from <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&amp;uddg=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCartoon_Saloon">Cartoon Saloon</a>, rivaling the likes the works of <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&amp;uddg=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FStudio_Ghibli">Studio
Ghibli</a>. Not surprising since the other work I enjoy from them is <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&amp;uddg=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThe_Secret_of_Kells">The
Secret of Kells</a> which is another excellent work to behold.
</p>

<p>
What I want to talk about in this short article is about the song. In
particular, why the song seem to have changed the scope of the story
which some people find some trouble with.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>SPOILER AHEAD</b></i>

<h2 id="org3ace081">Saoirse's Song</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3ace081">
<p>
The question is why did Saoirse's song save not just herself but also
the spirits in the story?
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/the-song-of-the-sea--saoirse-song.png" alt="Screenshot Of Saoirse's Song"/>
</p>

<p>
All that is expected of the song is that it saves her so saving the
surrounding spirits around her seems to come out of nowhere. On my
first viewing, I did not see it coming so I see why people think
similarly. Did the film foreshadow her song would save the spirits?
</p>

<p>
The most practical answer I can give is that something needed to
happen within the four minutes she was singing. If not, it would be a
scene of her spinning and singing in the air which might not be the
most visually meaningful. However, I refuse to believe the song is
just a filler music video clip, so let us look deeper in the film.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org63d40c6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org63d40c6">From The Script</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org63d40c6">
<p>
Reading into the script, there are several lines indicating that it
would. In the early scenes, Ben shows his father the picture on the
wall and says:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">BEN: She's singing her song so that she can send all the fairies home
across the sea.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Another reminder is right before the musical Deenashee is petrified,
one of them says:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">DEENASHEE: Human child, find the selkie's true coat, then she can sing
the song and save us all.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The Great Senachai says something that is more direct:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">GREAT SENACHIA: She'll be turned to stone soon, no doubt. You see,
without her coat, the selkie has no voice. And without her song, she'll
not last the night. And we'll all share in her fate.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The last sentence is very strange yet indicative of the stake involved
in saving Saoirse. So is the saving song foreshadowed enough? I don't
think so since these are just a couple of lines that one could easily
miss. A good foreshadowing would be a scene involving Bronach or other
selkies singing and having the same effect, so at best it is only
hinted at.
</p>

<p>
Instead, did the song need to save the spirits? Would the film change
if Saoirse was only healed and went back home? So let's explore the
meaning of the song.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4006401" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4006401">Bronach's Song</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4006401">
<p>
To be fair, it is known that Saoirse and her voice is magical.
Saoirse's stifiled singing through the shell was enough to break
Macha's magic; what more if is she used her true voice? (This is
speculation as power levels aren't really established anyway.) She was
only able to sing after Ben taught her their mother's song.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/the-song-of-the-sea--ben-teaching-the-song.png" alt="Screenshot Of Ben Teaching The Song"/>
</p>

<p>
Which is weird why Ben hasn't taught her the song before after six
years of being siblings but that further cements how important the
song is. Ben is the only one who has their mother's legacy: not the
coat, not the shell, but the tales and the song.
</p>

<p>
There is a fascinating line that their mother mentions before leaving:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">BRONACH: My son. Remember me, in your stories and in your songs. Know
that I will always love you. Always.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This is a clever narrative use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_tradition">oral tradition</a>: passing on the song
is passing on the memory and love. Ben teaching her the song is not
only symbolic of his forgiveness but also passing the love and legacy
of thier mother.
</p>

<p>
So the song is symbolically and thematically about love but how does
this factor in saving the spirits? At the very least though, the song
itself has meaning to exist.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0180fa2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0180fa2">The Selkie's Duty</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0180fa2">
<p>
It is interesting to note why their mother wasn't able to sing and
free the spirits from Macha's grasp earlier.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/the-song-of-the-sea--bronach-singing.png" alt="Screenshot Of Bronach Singing"/>
</p>

<p>
Clearly, Bronach can sing and Mac Lir is just outside. So why hasn't
she? Rather, it might not be that she won't but she can't. I think
Bronach might have no longer any magic or is waning. It might be
because she chooses to love Conor similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid">The Little Mermaid</a>. By
having little or no magic, giving birth to Saoirse might have taken
all that Bronach had remaining, which makes more sense in the context
of Ben being human and not a magical being.
</p>

<p>
Whatever the circumstance of the spirit or magical world, she cannot
sing to her duty as a selkie, which might be considered taboo or
illegal and adds a layer to her being a woman. Hence, the duty of the
mother falls onto the daughter.
</p>

<p>
What we need from the song is simply to call their mother and give
Saoirse the pivotal choice of staying or leaving with Ben. By singing
the song and sending the spirits home which not only fulfills
Bronach's neglected duty but makes her a selkie. This in turn calls
their mother's spirit and intends to take Saoirse as a selkie. From
this, we might infer that Bronach can't seem to cross to the human
world without a selkie's song guiding her to and from. Even without
thinking about the backstory, Bronach says this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">BRONACH: All of my kind must leave tonight. But, Saoirse, you are part
human. If I take her coat, our worlds will be untangled.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So sending the spirits home is pivotal to give Saoirse the choice of
not only staying but forgiving Ben. If Saoirse left to be with her
mother, it would mean Ben hasn't been good enough as a brother for her
to stay. So she forgives Ben by staying instead of leaving the person
who hurts or disregards her. Forgiving someone isn't simply a
conversation.
</p>

<p>
Interestingly, without the choice, forgiving Ben would not mean
anything without any narrative or personal impact. Saoirse, Ben and
Conor would simply be back home without much ado about nothing. The
film is quite clever in setting the stakes. (Who wants to lose their
beloved little sister?)

<h2 id="org752de5c">Other Subtleties</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org752de5c">
<p>
There are more subtleties that help in reading the film as a whole.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org58ebd7a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org58ebd7a">Doubles</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org58ebd7a">
<p>
Notice how the human and spirit world are similar or paralled in this
film. Mac Lear and Conor, Granny and Macha, Dan and The Great
Senechai, Saoirse and Bronach are human and spirit world equivalents
or doubles. Appearing to look similar and even the voice actors are
the same, this use of doubles or parallels heighten the only
character without a double: Ben. The hero's journey, growth and
forgiveness of Ben is further magnified.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4ef1a66" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4ef1a66">Circle</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4ef1a66">
<p>
Notice the use of circles is very strong. More importantly, the use
of it emphasizes how everything is connected and how the film is
centered around a family.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/the-song-of-the-sea--circle-within-circles.png" alt="Screenshot Of Circle Within Circles"/>
</p>

<p>
I believe the image above is the most helpful in reading the film.
Everything tied in one circle of tales.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4385bbf" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4385bbf">The Human And The Spirit World</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4385bbf">
<p>
The two previous fact heighten this fact: there is no distinction
between the two worlds. In most films, there is a portal or gateway
to the other world but in this film it blurs the line as the same.
The world of the magical is no more different from the world of the
real; this subtlely works quite well in showing how the problem and
resolution of the family and the world is almost the same.

<div id="outline-container-org1273d02" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1273d02">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1273d02">
<p>
I could have just said Saoirse needed to be a selki but we needed to
understand the meaning or weight of the song and what it allowed. In
the end, the song has such a sublime serenity and catharsis that one
cannot deny. For a film to have this depth and subtlety of choice, it
makes me appreciate it more. That is why I believe this is one of the
best films to watch that is both accessible yet sublime.
