<i><b>Dogville removes superfluous walls to examine moral actions</b></i>
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogville">Dogville (2003)</a> is a unique yet difficult film to watch. Aside from
using three hours and nine chapters like Quentin Tarantino's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hateful_Eight">The
Hateful Eight</a>. It presents a town with no walls but only a chalk
outline akin to an architectural blueprint. A town that is bare of
superfluous details such as walls and trees and roads and fence, just
the space where people live.

I like director, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_von_Trier">Lars von Trier</a>, and his other work <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melancholia_%282011_film%29">Melancholia</a> for
tackling different issues such as depression although his camera work
and visuals are somewhat stagnant. To compensate for the lack of
visuals, it must have a strong story or compelling characters. If you
have seen this and made it through, then it is for you to decide if it
is.
</p>

<p>
My focal point of dicussion is on the use of the setting and how it
correlates to its message. The message itself is somewhat direct with
a little subversion on tropes so I won't discuss that here.
</p>

<p>
<b>SPOILER ALERT</b>
</p>

<h2 id="orgd7732b5">A Town With No Walls</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd7732b5">
<p>
The audience can see the town has no walls but the actors are confined
by the space which they live in. This is akin to a stage play where
everything has been stripped to the bare minimum only to focus on the
actors. It is a strange setup indeed for a long and experimental film
but what does it really do? You may say it is a gimick to reduce
setting cost and excuse shoddy cinematography to which I might agree;
however, there is a thematic reason why it is used.
</p>

<p>
At a face value, this allows the audience to see the actors behind
walls. Obvious but misleading since the camera controls the viewpoint.
The true value of it can be seen from this unseen and horrendous rape
scene:
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
The audience sees the sexual assault but not the actors. Not only does
this heighten the devious act, this emphasizes the distance and denial
the towns people have. They are near but cannot or refuses to see what
is next to them. This disonnance between what the audience and actors
sees is what this setup bring.
</p>

<p>
However, it is not enough to justify it with a scene or two. To give
it meaning, it must be tied to the message or story of the film. The
town spiritual and moral leader is a philosopher, so this films hints
at saying something moral. A critical line from this philosopher is:
</p>

<p>
<i><b>The whole country would be better served with a greater attitude of</b></i>
<i><b>openness and acceptance</b></i>
</p>

<p>
Openness and acceptance. Hipocricy and denial, to be exact. By laying
down the extraneous walls, the town and its people are laid bare for
the audience to examine.
</p>

<h2 id="org337a4f6">Reflection</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org337a4f6">
<p>
After the hardships, hipocricy and cruelty the town has displayed to
Grace, the judgment at the end is well deserved although you could
reason more about it. More importantly, the initial decision to show
mercy yet reconsider wrath instead is very appropriate. Her reasoning
to be a martyr or merciful is hypocritical to what she reasons out,
which the film discusses with little for me to say. The theme of
self-examination runs deep.
</p>

<p>
The people themselves are deceptive in being kind at first but treat
her harshly later on and deny their abuse and wrongdoing. No one is
innocent specially the philosopher who merely uses words to his own
benefit.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
When Grace attempts to leave, no one bothered asking what they did
wrong in why should a person leave their small community. Instead,
they tie her up to a proxy ball-and-chain. This film is hard to watch
because of the treatment and reality of Grace, which might happen to
anyone. A dark interpretation of human morality.
</p>

<p>
Going back to our setup, aside from the town's ironic geographic
emotional size, it reflects how little in the town really matters.
Since majority of the details could be removed even the dog, there is
little to care for about the town and by extension its people.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
In a way, this supports Grace's decision to remove this morally
deceitful town. Notice the one that remains after the massacre is the
unknowing and pure dog. It goes a bit more abstract.

<h2 id="org5ac6cef">Abstraction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5ac6cef">
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">GRACE: Why not just call it Dogville?
TOM: Wouldn't work. No, it wouldn't work. It's got to be universal.
TOM: A lot of writers make that mistake.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Finally, the philospher indicates in naming his realized book to be a
universal name, not theirs furthering the meaning. However, it does
raise the point why the town is called Dogville. By joining the two
lines together, it indicates that the town itself is symbolic of
cruelty and hipocrisy happening anywhere.
</p>

<p>
So what if we imagine transparent walls around our homes, what would
it look like? Would it be just as Dogville be? If so would, that our
morality and courtesy be only our advantage? This is the literal
meaning of the setup, what is a world without walls? Do we want to see
beyond what our minds allow like bullying, abuse or rape in society?
</p>

<p>
Honestly as a hipocrite, I do not want to see what beyond the walls.
In that sense, is my morality truly a convenience? In general, is
morality that transparently empty?
</p>

<p>
Obviously there is more philosophical but this is the message of the
film. So in my opinion, the use of transparent walls was used to good
effect. A unique setup that I won't probably see in a long time.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org62e68cf">
<p>
The film is pretty straightforward in its meaning although long and
chatty. If you can stomach it, I encourage you to watch this gut
wrenching film for its unique story and depiction of morality. As for
me, it is one of my new favorite film that I cannot rewatch without
effort.
