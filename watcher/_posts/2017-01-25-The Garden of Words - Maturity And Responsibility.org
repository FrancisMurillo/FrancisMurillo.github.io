* The Garden of Words

  /*A faint clap of thunder, Clouded skies, Perhaps rain will
  come. If so, will you stay here with me?*/

  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Words][The Garden of Words (2013)]] for me is the second best in my list for
  Shinkai. After rewatching it and found it deeper than I thought it
  would be, I want to talk about this visually beautiful film. Aside
  from being emotionally and romantically moving, I want to talk about
  another aspect of there relationship namely the themes of maturity and
  responsibility.

  *SPOILER WARNING*

  *NOTE: Screenshots have reduced quality since they are too pretty to*
  *load fast. That's how pretty and defined the film's frames are.*

* Place And Time

  In order to discuss the relationship between our characters, let's
  discuss the mechanics of it. During rainy morning, each of our
  characters retreat to a tiny hut in a park where they accidentally and
  coincidentally meet and do so every rainy day.

  [[img:watcher/images/the-garden-of-words--the-tree-and-the-twig.png][Screenshot Of The Tree And The Twig]]

  Neither revealing who they really are and being in their own little
  solitude, both warm up to there shared isolation over time. This is a
  quiet and beautiful setup that I rarely see in films. A genre savvy
  person would cue this is as an opportunity to have a blooming
  relationship in an isolated environment where meeting outside this
  shelter is a plot revelation.

  Aside from being in their own world, the rain also plays quite a
  symbolic meaning here. The rain serves as a veil to the world they are
  escaping, the city noise muffled by the falling rain. This veil
  obscures the world to focus on them and their internal silence. It
  also serves as the extent of there initial relationship. Shrouded by a
  veil of escapism, neither revealing who they are outside, only what
  they wish to show inside. During their meetings under the shower, they
  are hidden and hiding themselves. Quite a poetic tone this setup
  yields.

  Another way to look at this setup is where people can be people
  without there social standing and responsibility. Our characters only
  know what the dressing means but they come bare without the chatter
  and stigma of it. Weary adults and youth, they can come here with
  their naked silence and weakness. A student and an office worker and
  nothing more and this is what the film settles on. Both skipping work
  and neither judge each other and talk about it. So they can go on
  without knowing there names or lives. This is what this place is, a
  place where solitude and privacy is respected.

  There is an asymmetry here that break the characters contracts. During
  their first meeting, the older woman recites a Japanese poem which I
  find very poignant and at the same time a hint on who she is. It
  implies she knows where the student goes and say something that the
  school might know. However, the student does not pick up on this
  subtle hint and they continue in their shared space.

* Characters

  A high-school student and a working woman. I understand if people find
  this a strange combination of a romantic relationship between an older
  woman a decade older than the man, but the context of their
  relationship should be examined. The examination I would like to focus
  on who is the child and adult.

** The Child

   Takao, the high schooler.

   [[img:watcher/images/the-garden-of-words--the-child.png][Screenshot Of The Child]]

   What makes him standout is that he is mature for his age: he does the
   cooking, he gets jobs to pay for his tuition, he has a dream that he
   is working on. Despite being a student, he is pretty mature in taking
   household and personal responsibility aside from skipping school on
   rainy mornings.

** The Adult

   Yukino, the literature teacher.

   [[img:watcher/images/the-garden-of-words--the-adult.png][Screenshot Of The Adult]]

   Although it is sad she is bullied by her students, she does not work
   for a while and decides to go to the park on rainy mornings. She does
   not know how to cook so she brings chocolates, where sweets are
   indicative of being childish. She drinks beer early morning as if to
   lull the day away. Ignoring responsibility, she is not a mature role
   model despite being a teacher.

** Conflict

   Symbolically, Takao is the adult while Yukino is the child while
   physically it is the opposite. Here is where opposites attract.

   [[img:watcher/images/the-garden-of-words--the-roles.png][Screenshot Of Their Role]]

   In the scene where Takao measures Yukino's foot, I find it beautiful
   and subtle. To contextualize, Yukino gives Takao a shoe design book
   which is somewhat the closest thing she has done in being a teacher
   by giving him a book that he cannot afford. To repay that kindness,
   Takao offers to make Yukino a shoe for her, handcrafting to show its
   personal and priceless value. This simple exchange shows their
   interest in each others space and world.

   Takao wants to be treated as an adult, going to school on a sunny day
   illuminates and reminds him of the fact that he is not. Granted that
   he is surprisingly independent, but the fact that he wants to be
   acknowledged as such shows he is not really one yet. One does need to
   tell everyone who they are to be who they really are. Weirdly, he
   thrust into this independence partly because his mother is gone
   hunting men or for the lack of a parental figure. The reason why he
   wants to be a shoe maker is presented in a way to please her mother
   and carried this dream or idea through his teenage years. By making
   shoes, will it give him the attention his mother had once given the
   shoe? Regardless, the presence of the mysterious adult Yukino allows
   him to connect to the world he wants as well fulfill this dream or
   desire to be noticed.

   On the other hand, Yukino is emotionally crippled by the people she
   is helping. For no fault of her own, one of her student falls for her
   but the girlfriend of this student started spreading rumors which
   caused the class to harass her. One subtle thing I had a hard time
   picking up is whether Yukino was in a relationship with another
   teacher, Itou, who broke up with her because he believed the rumors
   and dissuaded her in taking action since it might affect the school
   they are working on; if that is the case, she has no one to
   understand her. Either way by being seen as an adult and teacher, she
   cannot truly show this weakness and do her job since by not being
   emotionally reconciled and repressed she cannot effectively teach
   children how to be a strong adult and not a crybaby. So by being with
   a student that does not know her, her crippling isolation is slowly
   melting away by finding acceptance in him.

   You can say Yukino is indeed acting weak or immaturely but that is
   the point with her. Despite growing in years, it does not mean she
   grows emotionally on par. People are not invulnerable and get hurt,
   children and adults.

   So the nature and resolution of their conflicts and coincide with
   their communion. Their prayer for rain is really a heartfelt one so
   the response to the poem seem to suggest the answer:

   /*Even if rain comes not, I will stay here, together with you.*/

* Equal Footing

  The film uses walking here to symbolize the struggle with life and
  shoes the support and strength needed to continue with it. Rightly so,
  shoes are made for walking and to protect the feet from stones and harm.

  [[img:watcher/images/the-garden-of-words--forgetting-how-to-walk.png][Screenshot Of Forgetting How To Walk]]

  In line with responsibility, the thing I want to point out here is
  social status and footing. The phrase "on equal footing" holds weight
  here as it describes the relationship and catharsis for our
  characters. So the scene where Takao confesses to Yukino has so much
  meaning to address.

** Their Relationship Outside

   [[img:watcher/images/the-garden-of-words--the-happiest-time.png][Screenshot Of Their Happiest Time]]

   After meeting on a sunny day, a storm suddenly switches on which
   leads our characters to experience their relationship outside of it.
   I genuinely felt moved by the simple, short and quiet scene which
   shows what they had in their paradise remains true and valid even if
   all of it was a mystery and front. As it pains me to say this, their
   relationship has completed their conflict in terms of walking in life.

** Walking In The Sunny Season

   Once the rainy season had stopped, both characters cannot and will
   not go to their promised place because they had no reason. It looks
   cute that way but the clever use of light and rain indicates that
   there meeting is a dream made by rain and not just a time and place.
   So there relationship is in a hiatus but they move in their lives.

   Yukino decides during this period to move to another teaching job and
   Takao gets jobs to pay for his tuition and the shoe materials.
   Neither would have happened if they never shared their company. So
   when they met outside for the first time, they had already decided to
   walk.

   This is why the confession seems subtly heartbreaking.

** Rejection

   [[img:watcher/images/the-garden-of-words--sitting-rejection.png][Screenshot Of The Rejection]]

   When Takao confesses to Yukino, she is standing up and he is sitting
   down. Yukino then responds by saying to call her with her honorifics
   or the respect her status brings. She then sits downs and thanks him
   for essentially nothing by stressing the line.

   /*I was practicing how to walk on my own, there in that place.*/
   /*Even if am barefoot...*/

   This line means that she was doing fine without Takao and their
   relationship effectively has no bearing on their own walks. Moreover,
   there relationship before this was unclouded and unburdened by social
   responsibility and status, by demanding the honorifics it breaks the
   contract of their relationship. The point here is that Takao is now
   seen as a child with an infatuation for a woman a decade older than
   him.

   Notice the act of Yukino sitting down is similar to talking down a
   child and that when she does sit, they do not meet eye to eye as the
   division on the door divides it. Here is where Takao's age and status
   is a hindrance which he escapes in the park. As the kid, he loses out
   in the end as he takes his leave.

** Acceptance

   The cathartic scene where Yukino chases after Takao reiterates this
   emotion and the meaning of their footing, status, or the weight of who they
   really are.

   [[img:watcher/images/the-garden-of-words--uneven-footing.png][Screenshot Of Uneven Footing]]

   All Takao wanted was to be seen as a man or adult. In his eyes,
   everything was tipped against him. Yukino knowing more about him and
   not telling him she was a teacher at his school is indeed unfair as
   it looks like she was playing around with him. It is really unfair
   the adult gets the stick or prod.

   So when Yukino steps down to embrace Takao, their status are
   discarded to reveal that indeed she seems him as something more. They
   do no meet halfway, they meet as people. Let the tears flows.

   [[img:watcher/images/the-garden-of-words--equals.png][Screenshot Of Catharsis]]

   The next question is how does this fit in with their ending?

* Open Ended Maturity

  Yukino finally starts teaching again and Takao finishes the shoes. At
  the end of the film, Takao goes to the park on a snowy and leaves the
  shoes behind leaving their relationship as open-ended. Here is why I
  like the ending better is that the answer to it implies message to the
  whole story. To interpret the ending let us answer the meaning of
  Yukino leaving.

  [[img:watcher/images/the-garden-of-words--snowy-ending.png][Screenshot Of The Snowy Park]]

** Accepting Their Reality

   Simply if Yukino stays, she denies her actions in moving. In one way,
   she denies who she is just because she loves someone, which would
   undermine her reformed strength. She has a responsibility to herself
   to carry on and to Takao who is a child still. If their reality is to
   be considered, their relationship is inappropriate. Age, social,
   economical or whatever reason it might be, it would be wise if both
   parties mature further before doing so. This is emphasized by Takao
   with the parting lines:

   /*I was practicing how to walk too. That's what I think now.*/
   /*One day, when I  can walk much farther on my own...*/
   /*I'll go see her.*/

   Takao is indeed still a child and needs to walk and grow. This
   realization settles his path to maturity, that he need not hurry. By
   leaving the shoe, he shows resolve instead of waiting for her. So
   Yukino has finally acted like a responsible adult.

   What I pointed is out the coming to age theme of the film. Others
   have done like1 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLCL][FLCL]], but this does it coming from a teenagers point
   of view where it might hold better weight and perspective. I
   appreciate this portrayal of a teenager, it could have been about
   their romantic expressions or moments but I am thankful it was about
   their genuine need from each other. However, this does not answer
   what it means if they do hook up in the future.

** Meeting Up

   At this point, it is up to the reader's interpretation on the
   following points or ideas whether they should meetup. The guiding
   principle is interpreting it in the context of a mature relationship.

   - *The woman is years older* ::
        It is typical or preferable for the man to be older than the
        woman if fertility is a question.
   - *Takao shoemaking* ::
        His desire to make shoes comes from a childish idea. Would you
        consider his love for shoe making genuine or but a fad as his
        brother puts it? Would you consider leaving the shoes behind as
        leaving this idea behind?
   - *There relationship comes from a veil* ::
        Is it wise to have a relationship that does not truly know each
        other? I'm assuming Yukino left after their catharsis, so he
        still might know nothing about her. By that logic, their
        relationship might just be still at surface level. Should he
        really chase her then?

   Some might say love conquers all or some might say it is just a
   phase. Whatever you answer to the main question, it really reflects
   on the theme of maturity in their relationship. As for me, I'm okay
   if Takao forgets Yukino because their veiled relationship has done
   its work. Whether he decides to find her or not in time, we may never
   know.

   But isn't that love, a dream and a reality?

* Conclusion

  Dreamer or not, this short film is thought-provoking so much about
  teenage maturity and responsibility despite being a love story. That
  is why I find this second only to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Centimeters_Per_Second][5 Centimeters Per Second]] in terms of
  exploring aspects of relationships. This film is not perfect that
  these points might be too subtle, the open ending, the overly
  emotional ending, and so much more but I truly love this film and what
  it leaves behind.
