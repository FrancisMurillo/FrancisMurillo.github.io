So I just create a new blog for my animated viewing experience. As
long as it is art, I will consume it. I have been watching, analyzing,
discussing, reviewing and recommending visual consumption; I wanted to
put talk about as much as hacking, thus the new blog.
</p>

<p>
This is like the hacking blog, just a personal blog which I take my
leisure in writing about things that inspire. I do envy people who can
write creatively under pressure. I do take a lot of time writing. Very
long times. I do realize I now have to split my attention to two blogs
but since I am inspiration driven, I can't guarantee myself writing on
a specific topic even if I wanted to. In blog parlance I believe it is
called <span class="underline">cadence</span>, an periodic interval of writing blog entries so that
a routine can be established between the writer and the audience. I
thought a two week routine is good but I guess I'm not that good. My
promise to myself is at least write monthly for both blogs. Not a
strong promise but it will have to do.
</p>

<p>
I do have to say that this is also a technical achievement for myself
since I was able to configure the site support multiple blogs, a
natural progression I think. I am also refactoring my workflow as an
exercise and assessment on how far I've come in being an proud Emacs
user. As a side note, that library will be my next topic and
demonstration just to refresh my skills. I do enjoy writing my blogs
within <span class="underline">org-mode</span>, so simple and refreshing as a hacker. The side
effect of all this is the change in the main page but I'm still
deciding on how it looks like&#x2026; so get used to I guess.
</p>

<p>
To chart my course, I'm planning to write on the following topics for
this blog:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What my rating system is</li>
<li><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/32281/Kimi_no_Na_wa">Kimi no Na wa</a> message or lack thereof</li>
<li><a href="https://floatingintobliss.wordpress.com/2016/01/11/iyashikei-the-genre-of-catharsis/">Iyashikei</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_(2013_film)">Frozen</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I do enjoy my solitude and simplicity that if you want to complain
about my writing, then shoot me an (kind) email. I don't really go
into the forums or comments so I'm pretty oblivious most of the time
so I'm not the arbiter or judge for whatever I talk about. My research
is personal, so you can like or hate it but I won't really care that
much although I am inclined to the former.
</p>

<p>
Whatever, so again hello video watching blog. So I dub this side blog <b>The
Watcher</b> and the main <b>The Hacker</b>. May I write or die.
