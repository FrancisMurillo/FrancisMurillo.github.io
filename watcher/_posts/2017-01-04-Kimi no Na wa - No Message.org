*UPDATE 2017-01-20: Refactoring from ghosts to time travel, a logical*
*error. Also, making it more brief than longwinded.*

* Kimi no Na wa

  /*Kimi no Na wa has no obvious message about an aspect of relationships.*/

  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Name][Kimi no Na wa (2016)]] is one of Makoto Shinkai's beautiful work. It is
  visually magnificent, spectacularly directed and romantically moving.
  Praises and adulation, nothing less from his works and I would love to
  rewatch it. After noting how great it is from a viewing experience, I
  now want to talk about what it means to me.

  As a fan of his previous films, what I look for in his works are both
  beauty and meaning. After watching his films, I am lost in thought and
  emotion, asking for closure and meaning. However, I am not assuming
  you have seen his previous films, rather I will give my own
  interpretations and contrast it with this film.

  *SPOILER WARNING for this this and his previous films.*

* Present

  This film is a romantic story based on a body swapping mechanic. Not
  unique but the presentation of the relationship and cinematic
  execution is what makes this standout. And that Shinkai touch.

  In the lens of a three part act, the first act introduces their
  relationship brought about by the body swapping, the second act stops
  the swappingg and brings much needed mechanical exposition, the last
  act is the meeting of time and space. To elaborate the mechanic, the
  girl exists in a time three years before the boy and swap time and
  place every other day. The reason for it might be due to the magic of
  the circling comet and the hint that the boy's family itself might be
  time travellers. The actual mechanic itself is a little strange that I
  believe ghosts and out-of-body experiences served a more believable
  explanation than time travel. Regardless of errors in actual
  reasoning, my sentiment and thoughts are valid.

  So on my initial viewing, I stayed behind until the credits rolled
  because I could not think how it failed to ask questions about aspects
  of a relationship. I make this statement on the basis of asking if the
  main characters meeting has meaning aside from closure or catharsis. I
  find it hard to believe that this film is has nothing to say aside
  from having a nice teenage romance, which is not wrong but strange.

* Looking For Meaning

  A film may or may not have meaning or message. A film may be for a
  casual or artistic experience, so it is not required. My case is that
  after watching so many films, I want to find and watch films that are
  more than enjoyment. Although I do have moods in watching, I can only
  watch so many that I have to choose those with literal meaning and
  value.

  My general claim is that if a film has a message, it has more value
  than a film that doesn't. The judge is primarily execution and
  context, a bad film can have a message and a good film can have none.
  As a cerebral watcher, it is the message or themes that resonate and
  stays with me after the film rather than the emotional punch at the
  end. I am merely maximizing my time in watching, but it's good to have
  fun as well.

  I understand that there are pretentious films and that this is my
  personal gripe but I had my expectations for a Shinkai film: beautiful
  inside and out. If you want to understand my expectations, let's look
  at what his previous films said.

* Past

  Here is a list of his previous work with my quick interpretations:

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Place_Promised_in_Our_Early_Days][The Place Promised in Our Early Days (2004)]] ::
       Reality is more important than dreams
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Centimeters_Per_Second][5 Centimeters Per Second (2007)]] ::
       Moving on from your past
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_Who_Chase_Lost_Voices][Children Who Chase Lost Voices (2011)]] ::
       Accepting grief and sadness
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Words][The Garden of Words (2013)]] ::
       Being mature

  These may not be perfect interpretations but at least I had one for
  each of them. Each one deserves a post looking at there theme and
  message but for now I will justify my interpretations about each one
  to avoiding making this longwinded. Read on with a grain of salt.

** The Place Promised in Our Early Days

   /*Reality is more important than dreams*/

   [[img:watcher/images/kimi-no-na-wa--the-place-promised-in-our-early-days.png][Screenshot Of The Place Promised in Our Early Days]]

   This film is more complicated mechanically than the main film since
   it uses parallel worlds and scientific babble. Plotholes and
   complexities, there is a tower reaching the heavens which unites
   everyone in hope and dream, to reach the heavenly tower. For some
   reason, this tower took the main girl into itself and where the main
   boy gets into a chopper, gets the girl inside and destroys the tower.
   A little more complex than it has to be to present a romantic story.

   It took me quite a while to come to terms with this film and the
   easiest explanation I can give is this: the tower represents dreams
   and by destroying and getting the girl, reality is not as important.
   Put in another way, instead of dreaming of being together, let us be
   together.

   To add to this, there is a war where two countries are struggling and
   between them is the tower. A resistance force wants to unify the two
   by destroying it thereby removing the towering distance between them.

   More directly, the girl inside the tower and the boy outside dreams
   to be together. The tower is their promised place but by destroying
   it to free the girl, they have literally destroyed their paradise to
   be together.

   The tower represents that place in the distance that people can dream
   and share together, thus the symbolic ending is disheartening. Is it
   wrong to dream and live in that paradise?

   It is a complicated film but it has a message, although not something
   I endorse. In comparison to this theme and setup, I would prefer to
   watch [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Space_Force:_The_Wings_of_Honn%25C3%25AAamise][Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honeeamise]] as the simple
   symbolism of an everyday man of dreaming to launch to space is much
   more triumphant.

** 5 Centimeters Per Second

   /*Moving on from things that cannot be*/

   [[img:watcher/images/kimi-no-na-wa--5-centimeters-per-second.png][Screenshot Of 5 Centimeters Per Second]]

   This film is the reason why I am a Shinkai fan. It is a literal
   three-part structure represented by short stories, the first part
   shows the relationship between the leads, the second piece the
   distant growing between them, the last indicates how far they are.
   From the outset, I praise this film for showing how people get
   distant over time, a rare topic to cover. Although the film appears
   to be a sad, it is actually a happy one by showing the main
   protagonist moving on.

   Here the relationship has meaning. Although the can get close
   physically, they are worlds apart. During their separation, the woman
   has found a life while the man is longing for her too much. If they
   did hook up, it would simply be a tale in fate and destiny. However,
   by choosing to move on, it shows acceptance of things that cannot be.
   No matter how close they get, they are worlds apart despite how they
   dream of those early days.

   This is a subversion on the romantic ending and relationship that is
   well executed in tackling isolation and longing in a simple and
   realistic relationship. This is the essential Shinkai film in my eyes
   from which others are judged. Moving on.

** Children Who Chase Lost Voices

   /*Understanding and moving on from grief*/

   [[img:watcher/images/kimi-no-na-wa--children-who-chase-lost-voices.png][Screenshot Of Children Who Chase Lost Voices]]

   This film is standout from the roster. First, the message is very
   easy to understand, accepting grief. Nothing much to say or do with
   its simplicity but not that it is bad. If you consider grief as
   longing, then it is a reasonable theme for a Shinkai film.

   Secondly, this has a magical world much more akin to a Studio Ghibli
   film. Perhaps from social pressure of being a Miyazaki which is not
   needed as with Mamoru Hosoda? Not that I discourage it, he already
   has a distinct style that I appreciate.

   Lastly, the film has no romantic relationship to address, instead the
   question is changed to should they call for their dearly departed?
   The least Shinkai film.

   This film is not a masterpiece of story telling or world building but
   it does address grief on a journey to the other world simply.

** Garden Of Words

   /*Being mature is not being an aduly but a person maturing.*/

   [[img:watcher/images/kimi-no-na-wa--the-garden-of-words.png][Screenshot Of The Garden Of Words]]

   My second favorite Shinkai film while being a return to form from the
   previous one. It presents a relationship between a high schooler and
   a teacher in a way that puts them on equal footing. Their meetings on
   rainy morning in a park is an escapist paradise, where people who can
   be isolated from their fear. Through their meetings, they grow a
   relationship that transcend status and responsibility. It is a true
   Shinkai film.

   At some point in the film, the illusion is shattered and their
   relationship meets up with reality. Questioning both the maturity of
   the student and the responsibility of the teacher. What makes this
   different is that it ends on an open ending. By using such, the
   relationship is allowed a new start when both are more mature in
   their lives, instead of forcing an issue of age, status and
   responsibility.

   Among his previous films, this is the most complex in terms of
   understanding which I appreciate. A similar theme is done by [[https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&uddg=https%253A%252F%252Fen.wikipedia.org%252Fwiki%252FFLCL][FLCL]] but
   I prefer this for how much you have to look and think about the
   meaning of their relationship.

* The Meaining In Their Relationship

  /*What does it mean for the characters to be in a relationship?*/

  So the previous films have clearly a message about an aspect of
  relationship. Whether is it dreams, grief, maturity or distance, the
  main relationship has a question to answer. Coming back to the main
  film, what does it mean for the main characters to be in a
  relationship?

  If they meet up, it merely means fate and destiny; if they did not, do
  not mess with time travel. For the life of me, I cannot think of a
  deeper meaning to the film aside from the body swapping mechanics.
  Sitting in that theatre, I felt disappointed intellectually.

  In retrospect, this film is unique in that regard. Just being a solid
  teenage romance story but it feels hollow. For me, I watch Shinkai
  film because it has meaning, something most films can't give me.

* Conclusion

  Again, this is just my personal gripe, but I am marking this film. If
  we take Hideo Kojima's elegant but hollow [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_V:_The_Phantom_Pain][Metal Gear 5: The Phantom
  Pain]] or the wonderful but decaying series [[https://duckduckgo.com/lite/?q=spongebob][Spongebob]] as examples, these
  are reminders of being a fan.

  Anyhow, it is still a commercial success so I hope that funds a more
  meaningful film. I still recommend this film but it falls at the last
  place. I would strongly suggest _5 Centimeters Per Second_ or _The
  Garden of Words_ as the go-to Shinkai films.
