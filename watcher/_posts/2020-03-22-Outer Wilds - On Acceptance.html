<a href="http://www.outerwilds.com/">Outer Wilds</a> is a space exploration game where you launch your tiny
rocket and explore various planets to uncover the mysteries of the
galaxy. The game has a remarkable physics engine where flying in space
with an astronaut suit or the ship feels kinesthetically pleasing. Above
all, the game is artistic and meaningful with its overall message and
gameplay. It nails its theme of discovery and exploration by giving the
player all the tools upfront and not guiding the player in their journey
which is a rarity. Although the game is not for everyone specially who
are susceptible to motion sickness, this game deserves to be played and
experienced.

<p>
While the game is primarily about the joy of space exploration, the game
resonated with me differently. During my first playthrough, I launched
into space and delightfully agonized which planet to explore. Little did
I know, I first choose and crashed into the sea of the green planet,
<a href="https://outerwilds.gamepedia.com/Giant%27s_Deep">Giant's Deep</a>, then trying to find safety in land among the strong
cyclones and ocean currents. Wherever I escaped to next after some time
exploring, I heard an audio cue that lasted for a minute; then, the Sun
collapsed onto itself and transformed to a bright blue supernova slowly
consuming everything. I stood fixated in awe, took a deep breath and
kept my eyes open.

<p>
Death did not take me but was instead sent back in time right after the
start of the game. Why did the Sun explode? Why is the player sent back
in time when it does? Can this supernova be stopped or the home planet
saved? While the player is free to roam the galaxy, the Sun's time limit
forces numerous and unavoidable deaths which is heightened through the
first person view/experience. Over time, the player accepts death as a
natural part of the game, not simply an error/failure state that they
need to respawn or reload state.
</p>


<p>
While most players will solve this unpleasant mystery in the hopes of
saving the galaxy, perhaps the opposite is also a valid response. Death
should instinctively be avoided; however, the game with its technical
and spatial boundary does not let the player run away. It forces the
player to face it, yet it is not a painful experience. Neither a
tragedy nor conflict but the natural end of the solar system. To behold
that beautiful and radiant moment feels both religious and peaceful.
</p>


<p>
All this emotion was drawn out in the first loop, such a game is a rare
and personal gem. Whether players or readers felt differently, this game
not just invokes the fear of death, but also its acceptance through its
story and message that I want to discuss. To be clear, life and time is
precious and being more open to its end is a valuable insight.

To answer why the Sun is dying, the alien technology and knowledge left
behind the precursor race, <a href="https://outerwilds.gamepedia.com/Nomai">Nomai</a>, may lead to it. Indeed, our newly
graduated <a href="https://outerwilds.gamepedia.com/Hearthian">Heartian</a> astronaut protagonist is the only one equipped to
translate their language and thus understand their legacy. As the player
uncovers more about them and <a href="https://outerwilds.gamepedia.com/Ash_Twin_Project">Ash Twin Project</a>, it is found the <i>Nomai</i>
does not have a clear answer themselves. While other <i>Nomai</i> clans
exists, the ones that found themselves in the <i>Hearthian</i> galaxy
followed a signal older than universe itself known as <a href="https://outerwilds.gamepedia.com/Eye_of_the_Universe">Eye of the
Universe</a>. The incidental time loop and surviving technology were all in
service of finding this elusive origin. Even if the player discovers a
way to travel to it which is intended endpoint of the game, the player
is no closer to stopping the threat. In fact, the <i>Nomai</i> would escape
themselves and leave the danger behind once they found the coordinates.
Although the <i>Nomai</i> tried and failed to force the Sun to explode as a
power source, the Sun is simply at the end of its life.
</p>


<p>
If the <i>Nomai</i> do not have answers or powers to avert the crisis, what
then can stop the death of a solar system? Should the player place their
hope in the unknown <i>Eye of the Universe</i> can offer? Rather, if
something is naturally meant to die, do we have the right to prevent it
from doing so? The Sun is dying and the <i>Hearthians</i> should have been
evacuated if there was more time. The Sun will die, the <i>Hearthians</i>
will follow and so will the player character. One could read despair and
defeat, but perhaps the game is about accepting the inevitable or that
not all things can be saved.
</p>

<p>
As a final hope, when the player arrives at <i>Eye of the Universe</i>, the
Sun is far beyond the stars and possibly beyond danger. Inside however,
it is revealed that other solar systems or galaxies are dying indicating
the death of the universe, not just of the player's solar system. At the
end of the universe, the game lets the player sit by a campfire and
listen to the main theme as the new universe comes into light. To
emphasize, although the solar system collapses and the player dies which
contradicts the expectation of a lone hero or survivor, the universe and
life will eventually find a way. Death is not the end.
</p>

<p>
In light of the ending, the signal that is older than the universe or
the <i>Eye of the Universe</i> itself becomes interesting. The universe has
been possibly recreated several times and each time an observer sent
waves of harmony for the succeeding generation to remember and
ultimately find as the <i>Nomai</i> and <i>Hearthian</i> did together. If so and
one thinks of the time loop as a hindrance to one's personal or
emotional well-being, then it could be read as overcoming depression,
anxiety, pain, suffering and so on. As a personal reading, inescapable
and perpetual deaths tap into my anxieties and stopping the loop is
overcoming it; finishing the game becomes a therapeutic experience.
</p>


<p>
Related to that is <a href="https://outerwilds.gamepedia.com/Gabbro">Gabbro</a> who is the most relaxed <a href="https://outerwilds.gamepedia.com/Outer_Wilds_Ventures">Outer Wilds Venture</a>
member and more importantly also experiences the time loop like the
protagonist. Unlike the expected player, he is at peace with the
impending doom and even teaches the player to meditate through it which
is represented by the <i>Meditate Until Next Loop</i> option in the pause
screen. Happily surrendering to the next loop seems to be a form of
suicide without this option. If one needed to end the loop prematurely,
suicide by suffocating or crashing seems a viable strategy. With this
option however, it is not framed as such but instead as a calm
acceptance. Like with the other members though, he does not act on it
and lounges around making his peace as a lazy surrender than an
enlightenment. Still, his relaxed demeanor and personality contrasts the
player's anxieties.
</p>

<p>
Between the <i>Hearthian</i> explorers and <i>Nomai</i> thinkers, by making the
player embody the travelers spirit in this time loop, the focus shifts
on exploring the world for an answer than inventing one. Given the short
duration of the loop, knowledge and experience may seem futile but each
bit in each iteration add up. For a <i>Hearthian</i> specially, each loop is
a journey, each journey a precious experience. One last slight reach for
the ending, it is the <i>Nomai</i> who are thankful for the journey while
playing around a campfire as the new universe comes to life. If the
<i>Nomai</i> knew <i>Eye of the Universe</i> would lead them to the end, would
they have been so obsessed in chasing it across the stars? As an
<i>Hearthian</i>, the journey to the end of the world is romantic.
</p>


<p>
The strongest support for the theme comes with the loop itself. Making
the loop a repeated short cycle instead of a looming deadline is a
brilliant decision for the feeling and message. If it were a long
deadline or cycle, the feel and weight of death diminishes the longer it
looms in the distance. By being constantly reminded of the destruction
and impact of the end, it feels closer and personal how much it holds
the player. By making sure the player experiences it once, the white
explosion at the end contextualizes the Sun's nova. In changing the
scope and scale, as the loop ends for the player, a new loop begins for
the universe.

<p>
In simple ways, it is amazing how naturally this game taps into
anxieties of death. Other points can be made about the game such as the
physics, ships, planets, <i>Nomai</i> race, <i>Hearthian</i> explorer,
instruments, quantum objects, ethics and so on; but above all through
its restraint and commitment, it was able to deliver a meaningful and
positive experience for me and hopefully other players as well. What
more can you ask of a game?
