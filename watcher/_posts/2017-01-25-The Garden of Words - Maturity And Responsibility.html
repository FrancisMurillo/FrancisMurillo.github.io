<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Words">The Garden of Words (2013)</a> for me is the second best in my list for
Shinkai. After rewatching it and found it deeper than I thought it
would be, I want to talk about this visually beautiful film. Aside
from being emotionally and romantically moving, I want to talk about
another aspect of there relationship namely the themes of maturity and
responsibility.

<p>
In order to discuss the relationship between our characters, let's
discuss the mechanics of it. During rainy morning, each of our
characters retreat to a tiny hut in a park where they accidentally and
coincidentally meet and do so every rainy day.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Neither revealing who they really are and being in their own little
solitude, both warm up to there shared isolation over time. This is a
quiet and beautiful setup that I rarely see in films. A genre savvy
person would cue this is as an opportunity to have a blooming
relationship in an isolated environment where meeting outside this
shelter is a plot revelation.
</p>

<p>
Aside from being in their own world, the rain also plays quite a
symbolic meaning here. The rain serves as a veil to the world they are
escaping, the city noise muffled by the falling rain. This veil
obscures the world to focus on them and their internal silence. It
also serves as the extent of there initial relationship. Shrouded by a
veil of escapism, neither revealing who they are outside, only what
they wish to show inside. During their meetings under the shower, they
are hidden and hiding themselves. Quite a poetic tone this setup
yields.
</p>

<p>
Another way to look at this setup is where people can be people
without there social standing and responsibility. Our characters only
know what the dressing means but they come bare without the chatter
and stigma of it. Weary adults and youth, they can come here with
their naked silence and weakness. A student and an office worker and
nothing more and this is what the film settles on. Both skipping work
and neither judge each other and talk about it. So they can go on
without knowing there names or lives. This is what this place is, a
place where solitude and privacy is respected.
</p>

<p>
There is an asymmetry here that break the characters contracts. During
their first meeting, the older woman recites a Japanese poem which I
find very poignant and at the same time a hint on who she is. It
implies she knows where the student goes and say something that the
school might know. However, the student does not pick up on this
subtle hint and they continue in their shared space.
</p>

<h2 id="orgae98854">Characters</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgae98854">
<p>
A high-school student and a working woman. I understand if people find
this a strange combination of a romantic relationship between an older
woman a decade older than the man, but the context of their
relationship should be examined. The examination I would like to focus
on who is the child and adult.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd981907" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd981907">The Child</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd981907">
<p>
Takao, the high schooler.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/the-garden-of-words--the-child.png" alt="Screenshot Of The Child"/>
</p>

<p>
What makes him standout is that he is mature for his age: he does the
cooking, he gets jobs to pay for his tuition, he has a dream that he
is working on. Despite being a student, he is pretty mature in taking
household and personal responsibility aside from skipping school on
rainy mornings.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8c25889" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8c25889">The Adult</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8c25889">
<p>
Yukino, the literature teacher.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/the-garden-of-words--the-adult.png" alt="Screenshot Of The Adult"/>
</p>

<p>
Although it is sad she is bullied by her students, she does not work
for a while and decides to go to the park on rainy mornings. She does
not know how to cook so she brings chocolates, where sweets are
indicative of being childish. She drinks beer early morning as if to
lull the day away. Ignoring responsibility, she is not a mature role
model despite being a teacher.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1262ff4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1262ff4">Conflict</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1262ff4">
<p>
Symbolically, Takao is the adult while Yukino is the child while
physically it is the opposite. Here is where opposites attract.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/the-garden-of-words--the-roles.png" alt="Screenshot Of Their Role"/>
</p>

<p>
In the scene where Takao measures Yukino's foot, I find it beautiful
and subtle. To contextualize, Yukino gives Takao a shoe design book
which is somewhat the closest thing she has done in being a teacher
by giving him a book that he cannot afford. To repay that kindness,
Takao offers to make Yukino a shoe for her, handcrafting to show its
personal and priceless value. This simple exchange shows their
interest in each others space and world.
</p>

<p>
Takao wants to be treated as an adult, going to school on a sunny day
illuminates and reminds him of the fact that he is not. Granted that
he is surprisingly independent, but the fact that he wants to be
acknowledged as such shows he is not really one yet. One does need to
tell everyone who they are to be who they really are. Weirdly, he
thrust into this independence partly because his mother is gone
hunting men or for the lack of a parental figure. The reason why he
wants to be a shoe maker is presented in a way to please her mother
and carried this dream or idea through his teenage years. By making
shoes, will it give him the attention his mother had once given the
shoe? Regardless, the presence of the mysterious adult Yukino allows
him to connect to the world he wants as well fulfill this dream or
desire to be noticed.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Yukino is emotionally crippled by the people she
is helping. For no fault of her own, one of her student falls for her
but the girlfriend of this student started spreading rumors which
caused the class to harass her. One subtle thing I had a hard time
picking up is whether Yukino was in a relationship with another
teacher, Itou, who broke up with her because he believed the rumors
and dissuaded her in taking action since it might affect the school
they are working on; if that is the case, she has no one to
understand her. Either way by being seen as an adult and teacher, she
cannot truly show this weakness and do her job since by not being
emotionally reconciled and repressed she cannot effectively teach
children how to be a strong adult and not a crybaby. So by being with
a student that does not know her, her crippling isolation is slowly
melting away by finding acceptance in him.
</p>

<p>
You can say Yukino is indeed acting weak or immaturely but that is
the point with her. Despite growing in years, it does not mean she
grows emotionally on par. People are not invulnerable and get hurt,
children and adults.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
So the nature and resolution of their conflicts and coincide with
their communion. Their prayer for rain is really a heartfelt one so
the response to the poem seem to suggest the answer:
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Even if rain comes not, I will stay here, together with you.</b></i>
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4cd45fc" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4cd45fc">Equal Footing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4cd45fc">
<p>
The film uses walking here to symbolize the struggle with life and
shoes the support and strength needed to continue with it. Rightly so,
shoes are made for walking and to protect the feet from stones and harm.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/the-garden-of-words--forgetting-how-to-walk.png" alt="Screenshot Of Forgetting How To Walk"/>
</p>

<p>
In line with responsibility, the thing I want to point out here is
social status and footing. The phrase "on equal footing" holds weight
here as it describes the relationship and catharsis for our
characters. So the scene where Takao confesses to Yukino has so much
meaning to address.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org48dbbb6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org48dbbb6">Their Relationship Outside</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org48dbbb6">
<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/the-garden-of-words--the-happiest-time.png" alt="Screenshot Of Their Happiest Time"/>
</p>

<p>
After meeting on a sunny day, a storm suddenly switches on which
leads our characters to experience their relationship outside of it.
I genuinely felt moved by the simple, short and quiet scene which
shows what they had in their paradise remains true and valid even if
all of it was a mystery and front. As it pains me to say this, their
relationship has completed their conflict in terms of walking in life.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org822174f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org822174f">Walking In The Sunny Season</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org822174f">
<p>
Once the rainy season had stopped, both characters cannot and will
not go to their promised place because they had no reason. It looks
cute that way but the clever use of light and rain indicates that
there meeting is a dream made by rain and not just a time and place.
So there relationship is in a hiatus but they move in their lives.
</p>

<p>
Yukino decides during this period to move to another teaching job and
Takao gets jobs to pay for his tuition and the shoe materials.
Neither would have happened if they never shared their company. So
when they met outside for the first time, they had already decided to
walk.
</p>

<p>
This is why the confession seems subtly heartbreaking.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org78d67bb" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org78d67bb">Rejection</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org78d67bb">
<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/the-garden-of-words--sitting-rejection.png" alt="Screenshot Of The Rejection"/>
</p>

<p>
When Takao confesses to Yukino, she is standing up and he is sitting
down. Yukino then responds by saying to call her with her honorifics
or the respect her status brings. She then sits downs and thanks him
for essentially nothing by stressing the line.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>I was practicing how to walk on my own, there in that place.</b></i>
<i><b>Even if am barefoot&#x2026;</b></i>
</p>

<p>
This line means that she was doing fine without Takao and their
relationship effectively has no bearing on their own walks. Moreover,
there relationship before this was unclouded and unburdened by social
responsibility and status, by demanding the honorifics it breaks the
contract of their relationship. The point here is that Takao is now
seen as a child with an infatuation for a woman a decade older than
him.
</p>

<p>
Notice the act of Yukino sitting down is similar to talking down a
child and that when she does sit, they do not meet eye to eye as the
division on the door divides it. Here is where Takao's age and status
is a hindrance which he escapes in the park. As the kid, he loses out
in the end as he takes his leave.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb5e6e0b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb5e6e0b">Acceptance</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb5e6e0b">
<p>
The cathartic scene where Yukino chases after Takao reiterates this
emotion and the meaning of their footing, status, or the weight of who they
really are.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/the-garden-of-words--uneven-footing.png" alt="Screenshot Of Uneven Footing"/>
</p>

<p>
All Takao wanted was to be seen as a man or adult. In his eyes,
everything was tipped against him. Yukino knowing more about him and
not telling him she was a teacher at his school is indeed unfair as
it looks like she was playing around with him. It is really unfair
the adult gets the stick or prod.
</p>

<p>
So when Yukino steps down to embrace Takao, their status are
discarded to reveal that indeed she seems him as something more. They
do no meet halfway, they meet as people. Let the tears flows.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/the-garden-of-words--equals.png" alt="Screenshot Of Catharsis"/>
</p>

<p>
The next question is how does this fit in with their ending?
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4a0de37" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4a0de37">Open Ended Maturity</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4a0de37">
<p>
Yukino finally starts teaching again and Takao finishes the shoes. At
the end of the film, Takao goes to the park on a snowy and leaves the
shoes behind leaving their relationship as open-ended. Here is why I
like the ending better is that the answer to it implies message to the
whole story. To interpret the ending let us answer the meaning of
Yukino leaving.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/the-garden-of-words--snowy-ending.png" alt="Screenshot Of The Snowy Park"/>
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd12bafd" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd12bafd">Accepting Their Reality</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd12bafd">
<p>
Simply if Yukino stays, she denies her actions in moving. In one way,
she denies who she is just because she loves someone, which would
undermine her reformed strength. She has a responsibility to herself
to carry on and to Takao who is a child still. If their reality is to
be considered, their relationship is inappropriate. Age, social,
economical or whatever reason it might be, it would be wise if both
parties mature further before doing so. This is emphasized by Takao
with the parting lines:
</p>

<p>
<i><b>I was practicing how to walk too. That's what I think now.</b></i>
<i><b>One day, when I  can walk much farther on my own&#x2026;</b></i>
<i><b>I'll go see her.</b></i>
</p>

<p>
Takao is indeed still a child and needs to walk and grow. This
realization settles his path to maturity, that he need not hurry. By
leaving the shoe, he shows resolve instead of waiting for her. So
Yukino has finally acted like a responsible adult.
</p>

<p>
What I pointed is out the coming to age theme of the film. Others
have done like1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLCL">FLCL</a>, but this does it coming from a teenagers point
of view where it might hold better weight and perspective. I
appreciate this portrayal of a teenager, it could have been about
their romantic expressions or moments but I am thankful it was about
their genuine need from each other. However, this does not answer
what it means if they do hook up in the future.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7daf352" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7daf352">Meeting Up</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7daf352">
<p>
At this point, it is up to the reader's interpretation on the
following points or ideas whether they should meetup. The guiding
principle is interpreting it in the context of a mature relationship.
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><b>The woman is years older</b></dt><dd>It is typical or preferable for the man to be older than the
woman if fertility is a question.</dd>
<dt><b>Takao shoemaking</b></dt><dd>His desire to make shoes comes from a childish idea. Would you
consider his love for shoe making genuine or but a fad as his
brother puts it? Would you consider leaving the shoes behind as
leaving this idea behind?</dd>
<dt><b>There relationship comes from a veil</b></dt><dd>Is it wise to have a relationship that does not truly know each
other? I'm assuming Yukino left after their catharsis, so he
still might know nothing about her. By that logic, their
relationship might just be still at surface level. Should he
really chase her then?</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Some might say love conquers all or some might say it is just a
phase. Whatever you answer to the main question, it really reflects
on the theme of maturity in their relationship. As for me, I'm okay
if Takao forgets Yukino because their veiled relationship has done
its work. Whether he decides to find her or not in time, we may never
know.
</p>

<p>
But isn't that love, a dream and a reality?
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbbf620a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgbbf620a">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbbf620a">
<p>
Dreamer or not, this short film is thought-provoking so much about
teenage maturity and responsibility despite being a love story. That
is why I find this second only to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Centimeters_Per_Second">5 Centimeters Per Second</a> in terms of
exploring aspects of relationships. This film is not perfect that
these points might be too subtle, the open ending, the overly
emotional ending, and so much more but I truly love this film and what
it leaves behind.
</p>
</div>
