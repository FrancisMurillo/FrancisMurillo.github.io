* Song of the Sea

  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_of_the_Sea_%25282014_film%2529][Song of the Sea (2014)]] is one of the best hand drawn film I have ever
  seen from [[https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&uddg=https%253A%252F%252Fen.wikipedia.org%252Fwiki%252FCartoon_Saloon][Cartoon Saloon]], rivaling the likes the works of [[https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&uddg=https%253A%252F%252Fen.wikipedia.org%252Fwiki%252FStudio_Ghibli][Studio
  Ghibli]]. Not surprising since the other work I enjoy from them is [[https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&uddg=https%253A%252F%252Fen.wikipedia.org%252Fwiki%252FThe_Secret_of_Kells][The
  Secret of Kells]] which is another excellent work to behold.

  What I want to talk about in this short article is about the song. In
  particular, why the song seem to have changed the scope of the story
  which some people find some trouble with.

  /*SPOILER AHEAD*/

* Saoirse's Song

  The question is why did Saoirse's song save not just herself but also
  the spirits in the story?

  [[img:watcher/images/the-song-of-the-sea--saoirse-song.png][Screenshot Of Saoirse's Song]]

  All that is expected of the song is that it saves her so saving the
  surrounding spirits around her seems to come out of nowhere. On my
  first viewing, I did not see it coming so I see why people think
  similarly. Did the film foreshadow her song would save the spirits?

  The most practical answer I can give is that something needed to
  happen within the four minutes she was singing. If not, it would be a
  scene of her spinning and singing in the air which might not be the
  most visually meaningful. However, I refuse to believe the song is
  just a filler music video clip, so let us look deeper in the film.

* From The Script

  Reading into the script, there are several lines indicating that it
  would. In the early scenes, Ben shows his father the picture on the
  wall and says:

  #+BEGIN_SRC text
    BEN: She's singing her song so that she can send all the fairies home
    across the sea.
  #+END_SRC

  Another reminder is right before the musical Deenashee is petrified,
  one of them says:

  #+BEGIN_SRC text
    DEENASHEE: Human child, find the selkie's true coat, then she can sing
    the song and save us all.
  #+END_SRC

  The Great Senachai says something that is more direct:

  #+BEGIN_SRC text
    GREAT SENACHIA: She'll be turned to stone soon, no doubt. You see,
    without her coat, the selkie has no voice. And without her song, she'll
    not last the night. And we'll all share in her fate.
  #+END_SRC

  The last sentence is very strange yet indicative of the stake involved
  in saving Saoirse. So is the saving song foreshadowed enough? I don't
  think so since these are just a couple of lines that one could easily
  miss. A good foreshadowing would be a scene involving Bronach or other
  selkies singing and having the same effect, so at best it is only
  hinted at.

  Instead, did the song need to save the spirits? Would the film change
  if Saoirse was only healed and went back home? So let's explore the
  meaning of the song.

* Bronach's Song

  To be fair, it is known that Saoirse and her voice is magical.
  Saoirse's stifiled singing through the shell was enough to break
  Macha's magic; what more if is she used her true voice? (This is
  speculation as power levels aren't really established anyway.) She was
  only able to sing after Ben taught her their mother's song.

  [[img:watcher/images/the-song-of-the-sea--ben-teaching-the-song.png][Screenshot Of Ben Teaching The Song]]

  Which is weird why Ben hasn't taught her the song before after six
  years of being siblings but that further cements how important the
  song is. Ben is the only one who has their mother's legacy: not the
  coat, not the shell, but the tales and the song.

  There is a fascinating line that their mother mentions before leaving:

  #+BEGIN_SRC text
    BRONACH: My son. Remember me, in your stories and in your songs. Know
    that I will always love you. Always.
  #+END_SRC

  This is a clever narrative use of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_tradition][oral tradition]]: passing on the song
  is passing on the memory and love. Ben teaching her the song is not
  only symbolic of his forgiveness but also passing the love and legacy
  of thier mother.

  So the song is symbolically and thematically about love but how does
  this factor in saving the spirits? At the very least though, the song
  itself has meaning to exist.

* The Selkie's Duty

  It is interesting to note why their mother wasn't able to sing and
  free the spirits from Macha's grasp earlier.

  [[img:watcher/images/the-song-of-the-sea--bronach-singing.png][Screenshot Of Bronach Singing]]

  Clearly, Bronach can sing and Mac Lir is just outside. So why hasn't
  she? Rather, it might not be that she won't but she can't. I think
  Bronach might have no longer any magic or is waning. It might be
  because she chooses to love Conor similar to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid][The Little Mermaid]]. By
  having little or no magic, giving birth to Saoirse might have taken
  all that Bronach had remaining, which makes more sense in the context
  of Ben being human and not a magical being.

  Whatever the circumstance of the spirit or magical world, she cannot
  sing to her duty as a selkie, which might be considered taboo or
  illegal and adds a layer to her being a woman. Hence, the duty of the
  mother falls onto the daughter.

  What we need from the song is simply to call their mother and give
  Saoirse the pivotal choice of staying or leaving with Ben. By singing
  the song and sending the spirits home which not only fulfills
  Bronach's neglected duty but makes her a selkie. This in turn calls
  their mother's spirit and intends to take Saoirse as a selkie. From
  this, we might infer that Bronach can't seem to cross to the human
  world without a selkie's song guiding her to and from. Even without
  thinking about the backstory, Bronach says this:

  #+BEGIN_SRC text
    BRONACH: All of my kind must leave tonight. But, Saoirse, you are part
    human. If I take her coat, our worlds will be untangled.
  #+END_SRC

  So sending the spirits home is pivotal to give Saoirse the choice of
  not only staying but forgiving Ben. If Saoirse left to be with her
  mother, it would mean Ben hasn't been good enough as a brother for her
  to stay. So she forgives Ben by staying instead of leaving the person
  who hurts or disregards her. Forgiving someone isn't simply a
  conversation.

  Interestingly, without the choice, forgiving Ben would not mean
  anything without any narrative or personal impact. Saoirse, Ben and
  Conor would simply be back home without much ado about nothing. The
  film is quite clever in setting the stakes. (Who wants to lose their
  beloved little sister?)

* Other Subtleties

  There are more subtleties that help in reading the film as a whole.

** Doubles

   Notice how the human and spirit world are similar or paralled in this
   film. Mac Lear and Conor, Granny and Macha, Dan and The Great
   Senechai, Saoirse and Bronach are human and spirit world equivalents
   or doubles. Appearing to look similar and even the voice actors are
   the same, this use of doubles or parallels heighten the only
   character without a double: Ben. The hero's journey, growth and
   forgiveness of Ben is further magnified.

** Circle

   Notice the use of circles is very strong. More importantly, the use
   of it emphasizes how everything is connected and how the film is
   centered around a family.

   [[img:watcher/images/the-song-of-the-sea--circle-within-circles.png][Screenshot Of Circle Within Circles]]

   I believe the image above is the most helpful in reading the film.
   Everything tied in one circle of tales.

** The Human And The Spirit World

   The two previous fact heighten this fact: there is no distinction
   between the two worlds. In most films, there is a portal or gateway
   to the other world but in this film it blurs the line as the same.
   The world of the magical is no more different from the world of the
   real; this subtlely works quite well in showing how the problem and
   resolution of the family and the world is almost the same.

* Conclusion

  I could have just said Saoirse needed to be a selki but we needed to
  understand the meaning or weight of the song and what it allowed. In
  the end, the song has such a sublime serenity and catharsis that one
  cannot deny. For a film to have this depth and subtlety of choice, it
  makes me appreciate it more. That is why I believe this is one of the
  best films to watch that is both accessible yet sublime.
