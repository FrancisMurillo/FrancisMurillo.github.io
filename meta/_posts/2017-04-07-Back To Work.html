This sub-blog, <b>Meta</b>, is meant primarily for notifications or
announcements, thus it has no dedicated section itself. Primarily,
these posts are not for <i>Hacker</i> or <i>Watcher</i> blogs but for the status
of the blog or audience itself. <b>A space to explain myself, thus it
does not deserve its own space as it is personal.</b>
</p>

<p>
After living in my writing and hacking paradise for a long time, it is
time to return to the field. Precisely, I start working this coming
Monday (<b>April 10, 2017</b>). The loss in time will affect my ability to
produce well crafted and creative articles where <b>my goal is to write
an article for each blog monthly which is two articles monthly.</b>
</p>

<p>
Refactoring the schedule and intention, <b>I plan to write an article
biweekly</b>, hopefully covering both blogs. For now, I will publish an
article for each blog this Sunday (<b>April 09, 2017</b>) to mark my change
in lifestyle. For the <i>Hacker</i> blog, it is about the builtin bar chart
library of Emacs, <code>chart</code>; for <i>Watcher</i>, it is an analysis on
<b>Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter&#x2026; and Spring (2003)</b>.
</p>

<p>
I do hope I can finish it in time as I still have to study and review
everything needed to work productively and efficiently. My history of
procrastination haunts my future outlook. Someday, I can make my
writing content better and my living. Someday.
