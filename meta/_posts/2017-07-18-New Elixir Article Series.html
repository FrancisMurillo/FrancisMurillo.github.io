It has been quite a while since I wrote something, breaking my own
goals of writing a blog entry for my two blog categories. I have been
quite busy ramping up to <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> language and <a href="http://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a> framework to
develop the backend because of the promise of efficient sockets. If
the project was a routine REST API, I need not find a suitable
language from the stack of <a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a> as the REST API and <a href="https://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> with <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a>
as the socket server that can be tricky to scale and maintain. I took
a great burden for myself and my team in making this decision which I
must own up and show the trade-off is valuable to the customers and
company.
</p>

<p>
For the past working months, I have been busy in learning and leading
this endeavor; however, I have not been idle with any creative ideas.
In particular, my quest for a sample <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> <a href="http://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> application led me to
develop a UI for <a href="https://github.com/adamtornhill/code-maat">code-maat</a> that will be an article once I have
integrated <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> visualization. With the same lead, I plan to make a
simple platforming game in the same stack to consider the theme of
solitude though the mechanics are still in the pipes. Sadly, promises
of new article is as vague as the wind.
</p>

<p>
In light of my decision and lack of articles, I plan to write a series
of short articles for the new language to aid in my review as well as
knowledge sharing. Series name aside, this new short series is not
part of the main course thus it will not appear in the news feed to
avoid feed noise. This new series will take time and attention from
writing in my main blog but this is more aligned at the moment with my
objective and education. For this optional series, I expect to write
at least one article a week if I can. Although I am not an expert, I
expect the same or better quality and attention in writing and
research. Expect the first article by this week or the weekend.
</p>

<p>
Although this update may not be good news, I do miss the days and
feeling of writing. For now, priorities and decisions must be
realigned and this short series will fill the gap.
