<p>
I haven't written in quite a while with the usual excuse of being too
busy which eats me up inside. Truly, I wanted to truly write, but I was
unhappy with the CSS and structure of my blog which caused some mental
energy and paralysis. It was a skeleton that I heavily modified;
however, when it was time to understand and modify it to my liking, I
could not understand it. Lesson learned in just writing it yourself
for long-term maintenance.
</p>

<p>
For the past weeks, I was refactoring the skeleton to use flexbox and
it did take some time. At last, I own the structure now (more or less)
and happy. In between, I made some changes to my site:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><b>Header is now an arrow</b></dt><dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>
I wanted to make my header an arrow with diagonal separators but
couldn't at the time. Now it reflects my `header-line-format` better.
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><b>Links reflect the Emacs tutorial</b></dt><dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>
Inspired by the Emacs tutorial links, so I emulated them.
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><b>Deleted some posts</b></dt><dd></dd>
</dl>
<p>
Some posts I wasn't happy, so I hid (not delete) them from my site. You
can still access them if you know the link which I hope you lost.
</p>

<p>
I plan to write one Emacs hack, one Emacs library usage, one positive
and negative film case and one mathematics problem to try writing with
LaTeX via mathematical proofs. Nonetheless, I hope you do like the
changes and I can now finally move on to writing again.
