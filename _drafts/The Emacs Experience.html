Being in a company with no other known Emacs user, I write this article as a way for me to express what unspoken awe I feel about Emacs. My goal is not shove people into the gauntlet of Emacs(or vi), I want to be understood. Or maybe just to tell a good story.

My first impression of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> is that it is an customizable text editor. The pitch doesn't sound epic and there are other customizable text editors like  <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> or <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> with their extensions. What makes it different really different is that it comes with it's own programming language, [[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp%5D%5BElisp">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp%5D%5BElisp</a>](a variant of Lisp)
