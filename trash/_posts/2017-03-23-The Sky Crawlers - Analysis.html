<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sky_Crawlers_(film)">The Sky Crawlers (2008)</a> is an art film disguised as war film.
Considering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamoru_Oshii">Mamoru Oshii</a> previous works such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel%27s_Egg">Angel's Egg</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin-Roh%3A_The_Wolf_Brigade">Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade</a>, this film is expected to artistic or not
typical. Indeed, this film is quiet and philosophical although it does
not fully translate to engaging or entertaining. The story itself is
convoluted and characters uninteresting but not without merit or
meaning. As a simple synopsis, a boy joins a military air force and
discovers the truth about the war and himself. Seems like a normal
coming of age.

Rather than discussing the actual story, this article will tackle
several points but not necessarily join them under a unified idea;
rather, finding the branches show where the tree lies. Finally, take
my words with a grain of salt as I am merely talking about the things
that made me appreciate this film.

<h2 id="org032c9fe">Coming of Age</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org032c9fe">
<p>
Several titles have raised this theme of maturity such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLCL">FLCL</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Words">The
Garden of Words</a>, but it is raised here by the concept of kildren. To
reiterate, <i>kildren</i> are genetically modified clones that live forever
and stay in adolescence, the dream of being a teenager eternally.
Strangely, they behave like any adult would: drink beer, engage in
casual sex, smoke, kill, and bear children. <b>What then is the
difference between an adult and an eternal teenager?</b> It certainly is
not their physicality.
</p>

<p>
Rather, what is the point of this mechanic if it is conflicted? First,
our protagonist says that they can be adults be chooses not;
regardless of how, maturity is instead a choice or option that
disregards why they are in eternal adolescence. Second, <i>The Teacher</i>
is unbeatable or stronger by virtue of being a man or adult;
regardless of why, nobody evidently matures to make a comparative
comparison, before and after changes if you will. Third, the <i>kildren</i>
make the excuse that death may come tomorrow thus why bother maturing;
a skewed yet reasonable excuse. Fourth, they are meant or designed to
be kids. <b>All these points seem to be questioning this core mechanic</b>,
instead of supporting it. If it was setup to be questioned, it seems
arbitrary, artificial or contrived.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/the-sky-crawlers--kids.png" alt="Screenshot Of Kids"/>
</p>

<p>
Most protagonist matures by the trials and tribulations in the story
and the characters are clearly setup to be children. Indeed, the final
fight is about succeeding the father as indicated by the line <i>I'll
kill my father.</i> Similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_3:_Snake_Eater">Big Boss from Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake
Eater</a>, killing <i>The Teacher</i> is implicitly inheriting the role of the
strongest pilot, not necessarily unbeatable; symbolically, that person
is an adult. Although shot down, <b>the story is strangely similar to a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_of_age">coming of age</a>.</b> Whether <i>The Teacher</i> is a normal human or <i>kildren</i>,
the teacher or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensei">sensei</a> is the guide or parent the students or children
must surpass, a fitting name in context.
</p>

<p>
However, this is only symbolic; defeating <i>The Teacher</i> does nothing
as the system will perpetuate itself. Ultimately, the act does make
anyone mature; rather, nobody changes or matures during the entire
film. <b>The dissonance between the abstract and real subverts the theme
of coming of age.</b> This subversion argues that maturity is not
necessarily the answer, but something else entirely specially to their
unending circumstance.
</p>

<p>
What is the answer? Perhaps, no answer exist as the film ends where it
starts. If I were them, I would blow up the faceless and symbolic
company creating <i>kildren</i> like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitman_(video_game_series)">Agent 47 from Hitman</a>, but that itself
is not the end. To conclude from a saying, <b>a child is an adult who
needs more time</b>, even in the face of immortality.
</p>

<h2 id="orgf18319c">Entertainment</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf18319c">
<p>
<b>If you take all the dogfight scenes and remove everything else, you
could argue the result would be a more engaging film</b>; however, in
doing that it shows the preference to be entertained rather than
learn. If the war is for entertainment, then the fights are
meaningless; even if you consider the final scene to be meaningful, it
is a futile fight.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/the-sky-crawlers--snap-reversal.png" alt="Screenshot Of The Snap Reversal"/>
</p>

<p>
The film satisfies the minor and major fight requirements yet are
hollow in context. Subtly, the fights are to serve both the internal
audience and external viewer. The need to be distracted. In that way,
the film does not need dogfights, but flashes of light and sound.
</p>

<p>
Hypothetically, you might change the film that shows cops and robbers
instead of war; as consumers of TV, anime, movie or film media, should
it be concerned with telling a story or entertaining us? In
entertainment, we see and take from it yet it is fake or produced.
With the act of re-imagining the conflict or action, it talks about
the viewer, the reason and the purpose. For example, the action can be
about wrestling with masked fighters, pro-gaming with character
creations, supermarkets with market activity, or anything with a sided
conflict. Although the aspect of direct death is removed, <b>the
interchangeability suggests that the action is superficial</b>, both in
the story and to the viewer. After all, the military base is called a
theater.
</p>

<p>
If the film is boring, then it might have been meant that way but not
without artistic effect or meaning. The effect is that the viewer
experiences the superficiality and grind that our protagonist feel
without being preachy or direct. Avoiding hypocrisy, <b>should a film
criticizing entertainment be entertaining?</b>
</p>

<p>
Instead, <b>what is important to the film if it itself is superficial?</b>
To look for meaning in the void? Strangely, the protagonist and the
viewer are doing the same thing; the struggle of finding purpose in a
meaningless world or film? If the search is not inside or within, is
it outside or external? Is this film asking us to find value not
within the film or art? The question of purpose is fascinatingly
hidden yet absent in this superficial film.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgc91c44d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc91c44d">Video Games</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc91c44d">
<p>
If the whole film was framed as an air plane simulator like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Combat">Ace
Combat series</a>, the mechanics and meaning will make more sense. A
simple definition, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game">game</a> is an exercise that has rules or mechanics
and an objective. Being loose, here are some points that allude to the
film as a video game:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><b>The Teacher as the final boss</b></dt><dd>The pilot that can never be beaten. The player must earn enough
experience to "kill the father".</dd>
<dt><b>Kildren as player avatars</b></dt><dd>If the kildren are clones, they come from a base of available
players to select.</dd>
<dt><b>Unlimited sorties as missions</b></dt><dd>The entertainment war allows for uncountable missions before
fighting the final boss.</dd>
<dt><b>Death as a failure state</b></dt><dd>If the kildren die, it is a game over and the player has to
recreate or clone his player to try again.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
These points might not define a true game but it is does allude to
elements of online role-playing and action games. If the post-credit
scene zoomed out to a screen, it would reinforce the message of war as
meaningless entertainment because playing war is the game.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/the-sky-crawlers--war-is-a-game.png" alt="Screenshot Of War Is A Game"/>
</p>

<p>
Even without that, the film can be thought of as a large scale action
game. To be exact, a video game, not just a game. What ultimately
leads me to this idea is the cyclic or restart mechanic. Each time our
protagonist dies, the game or cycle repeats. Similarly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day">Groundhog Day</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_of_Tomorrow">Edge of Tomorrow</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steins%3BGate">Steins;Gate</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code">Source Code</a> can be thought of as
games but the emphasis is greater on this film.
</p>

<p>
Before the final fight, the protagonist makes a comment that can be
interpreted in the lens of video game disenchantment:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">KANNAMI: You can change the side of the road
         that you walk down every day.
         Even if the road is the same,
         you can still see new things.
         Is that not enough in life?
</pre>
</div>

<p>
<b>Is it enough to keep playing a game differently?</b> If the game has
been played, what reason is there to play again? Fun? Completion?
Tradition? Regardless, what reason is there to live even if the game
cannot be beaten? This is hinted by the suicide of the protagonist's
previous reincarnation. What is disheartening about this action is
that death is rendered meaningless by reincarnation or respawn
mechanic; the game must be played continuously and endlessly despite
reason or purpose. For the player or protagonist, does this sound like
insanity?
</p>

<p>
The game frame raises a fundamental question: <b>who is the player?</b> It
may be the faceless and symbolic cloning company or the hapless
<i>kildren</i> themselves, but an interesting answer is the curious viewer
who will keep playing the video until boredom or meaning is achieved.
Indeed, what do we look for in video games or films? Story? Action?
Fun? Distraction? Meaning? Rather, if the film was meant to have no
strong story or meaningful action, the film works as a subversion of
substance both on the actual and meta level, game or not. In context,
are games about flash and lights, and less about meaningful mechanics
or values? To sketch the game analogy with the plot points in mind:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Start a new game (Start of the film)</li>
<li>Foreshadow the story (<i>The Teacher</i> as final boss)</li>
<li>Choose an avatar (Introduction of main character)</li>
<li>Play a few missions with interspersed story (Dog fights)</li>
<li>Final boss unlocked (Death of <i>kildren</i> allies)</li>
<li>Increase stats or level (Time-lapse after the realization)</li>
<li>Challenge the dragon (Fighting <i>The Teacher</i>)</li>
<li>Game over (Killed in combat)</li>
<li>Restarting a new game plus with the same avatar (Cloning of <i>kildren</i>)</li>
<li>Repeat until the game boss is beaten (End of film)</li>
<li><b>Is the player expecting a reward on each replay?</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
This idea is not definitive but to say the film could be a framed or
presented as a game is not a bad idea. Given the mechanics above, a
video game taking from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem">Fire Emblem</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls">Dark Souls</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Combat">Ace Combat</a> can be
made subverting the air plane simulator genre and playing in general.
Although a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sky_Crawlers%3A_Innocent_Aces">video game</a> exist that expands on the story of <i>The
Teacher</i>, the idea is primarily a subversion as with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotline_Miami">Hotline Miami</a> or
more closely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spec_Ops%3A_The_Line">Spec Ops: The Line</a> but backstory would be appreciated for
the lack. To summarize, <b>by imagining this film framed in a video
game, it questions what the viewer or player expects of it.</b>

<h2 id="org32ede9c">Unexplored Points</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org32ede9c">
<p>
Here are some other points that I couldn't fully explore because of
time limitations:
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orge2a8a95" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge2a8a95">The Diner Man And Old Man</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge2a8a95">
<p>
<b>Who is the old man outside <i>Daniel's Diner</i></b>? Strangely, when the
diner waiter or server sat beside him, they look oddly similar.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/the-sky-crawlers--the-diner-men.png" alt="Screenshot Of The Diner Men"/>
</p>

<p>
Even if they are not, what does he represent? Rather, <b>he is the only
old person in the film.</b> Speculating, the old people are not taken
care of. Nobody, not even the protagonist bothers to offer him a
jacket or smoke. Perhaps, old people don't exist or are less than
<i>kildren</i> who are pitied when they die. (Another old person exist
within the same scene but not directed or focused by the screen.) Who
he is and his significance, we may never know.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga6ee9f9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga6ee9f9">Counting</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga6ee9f9">
<p>
An early dissonance that kept me intrigued in the counting error when
the white haired pilot says there is usually three of them but there
are four of them if the previously killed pilot was included.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/the-sky-crawlers--counting-error.png" alt="Screenshot Of Counting Error"/>
</p>

<p>
That is strange indeed. Even stranger when just before the final
fight, there are six planes. With the respawn mechanic, we have the
base three, the new female, the twins and our protagonist that makes
seven in total.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/the-sky-crawlers--another-counting-error.png" alt="Screenshot Of Another Counting Error"/>
</p>

<p>
When the planes return, the little sister makes a point in counting
the planes that return. Why count when the accounting is wrong?
Another scene is when our protagonist tells the commander there are
three bombers instead of two.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/the-sky-crawlers--three-not-two.png" alt="Screenshot Of Three Bombers, Not Two"/>
</p>

<p>
As viewers, we can clearly see two bombers but why is our protagonist
saying three. Why is there an incongruity on counting? I could be
counting wrong and reading into it too much, but this is given some
screen time. The question is <b>what does it mean that people can't
count properly?</b> Even stranger, the film doesn't even use this fact,
as if it is a running gag or quirk. Several things come to mind but
it might be a mystery that might drive me insane.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org707b1ef" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org707b1ef">Empty City</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org707b1ef">
<p>
Why is the new city empty? During their bowling session, they are
girls playing but why is there no soul tapping the sidewalk?
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/the-sky-crawlers--empty-city.png" alt="Screenshot Of The Empty City"/>
</p>

<p>
This could be a visual style, nothing truly symbolic or to read in
to. Thankfully, I am not bothered as much, only slightly.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5f0d4c4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5f0d4c4">The Old Lady</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5f0d4c4">
<p>
The old lady (or more likely the whore) is somewhat a chronicler of
the times as she knows who <i>The Teacher</i>, previous and current pilot
are.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/the-sky-crawlers--the-whore.png" alt="Screenshot Of The Whore"/>
</p>

<p>
Her identity is not a big deal but I can only guess that she is the
owner as indicated by her back tattoo. Just like with <i>The Mother</i> or
chief mechanic, they're willingness to be normal human actors in the
game is intriguing; wouldn't they want change as well? Nonetheless,
not a big deal.
</p>

<p>
Aside, I think the animal in her back reminds me of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VIII">Leviathan from
Final Fantasy VIII</a> and the animal in her front is an owl but both are
guesses and can find no substantial links or hints.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7c101d2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7c101d2">Albert Camus</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7c101d2">
<p>
During the first meeting with the commander, she mentions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus#The_Myth_of_Sisyphus">(Albert)
Camus</a>, an existential philosopher. In particular, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus#Chapter_4:_The_Myth_of_Sisyphus">The Myth of
Sisyphus</a> might be a better allegory or comparison to the film. I am
not an expert in the source but a quick read alludes to several
themes to the film itself such as meaning, suicide and futility.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org8cb5967" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8cb5967">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8cb5967">
<p>
To conclude, all these points don't necessarily redeem the film but
makes it intriguing from an intellectual and meta level. I have
probably spent too much time thinking or writing about it than but I
do wish to explore what else this weird experience means. I don't know
if the film has a unified idea but it could have one more than many.
<i>Mamoru Oshii</i> really knows how to drive me insane.

I can't recommend this to anyone, even for intellectuals, but I do
hope my writing has eased the mental struggle for those who seen this
as I have.
