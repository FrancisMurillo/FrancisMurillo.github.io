<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1afedea">
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_and_the_Extraordinary_World">April and the Extraordinary World (2015)</a> is a good adventure film that
is quite rare to see these days. Although it covers many topics
including, it is never bogged down and never goes exhibits the typical
science is evil cliche. While watching, I felt this had a <i>Ghibli</i> vibe
to it.
</p>

</p>

<p>
In this short form, I explain where I find the <i>Ghibli</i> tropes or
vibes. As a <i>Ghibli</i> fan, I have seen majority of its films to have
the right to mention its similarities or tropes.
</p>

<i><b>SPOILERS AHEAD</b></i>

<h2 id="org48295cf">Talking Cat</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org48295cf">
<p>
I like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiki's_Delivery_Service">Kiki's Delivery Service (1989)</a> and I like cats, thus I like
<i>Gigi</i> although he may not be a vital character. When I saw the
talking cat, <i>Darwin</i>, I made the connection.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/april-and-the-extraordinary-world--talking-cat.png" alt="Screenshot Of A Talking Cat"/>
</p>

<p>
The similarity ends when the animal sidekick becomes a vital character
in relaying information, getting in unreachable places and possibly
saving the world from annihilation. This talking black cat strangely
raises the bar for what sidekicks can accomplish.
</p>

<p>
Along the same lines, the protagonist seems like an older <i>Kiki</i>
specially when she gets her pink dress. Similar only to a dress as our
protagonist is smarter and less moody although the romance could have
been removed.

<h2 id="org9127bff">Missing Parents</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9127bff">
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirited_Away">Spirited Away (2001)</a> is a masterpiece, the quintessential or
representative <i>Ghibli</i> film. Weirdly, is it a thing to take the
parents away or turn them into pigs?
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/april-and-the-extraordinary-world--lost-parents.png" alt="Screenshot Of Lost Parents"/>
</p>

<p>
The strange thing is that the parents are meddling or planning on
their own, meaning they are not irrelevant. In a way, the parents
exist or their presence is felt in the story.

<div id="outline-container-orgf3283e1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf3283e1">Flying Machines</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf3283e1">
<p>
I consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausica%C3%A4_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind_%28film%29">Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (1984)</a> as a <i>Ghibli</i>
film although it predates the founding of the studio. When the
lightning cloud and various flying machines appeared, I can't help but
think of the original wind rider.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/april-and-the-extraordinary-world--flying-machines.png" alt="Screenshot Of Flying Machines"/>
</p>

<p>
It is not that air planes exist but how they make the world more
magical like with the lightning plane or airships.

<h2 id="org8a98e96">Magical Stone</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8a98e96">
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_in_the_Sky">Castle in the Sky (1986)</a> is a good film in their repertoire but
nothing I would cry about. When the snow globe of our protagonist was
injected with the serum, I thought about the magical stone pendant.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/april-and-the-extraordinary-world--snow-globe.png" alt="Screenshot Of A Magical Stone"/>
</p>

<p>
The snow globe became magical or imbued with power to bring life
through the elixir of science. This notion ends once it is known the
old elixir does not work but the new, a fake-out.
</p>

<h2 id="org1da671d">Moving Fortress</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1da671d">
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howl%27s_Moving_Castle_%28film%29">Howl's Moving Castle (2004)</a> is a classic specially the magnificent
soundtrack. When I saw the <i>Meta-Mansion</i>, I was looking for
<i>Calcifer</i>.
</p>

<p>
<img src="/watcher/images/april-and-the-extraordinary-world--meta-mansion.png" alt="Screenshot Of A Moving Castle"/>
</p>

<p>
The similarity ends since there is no flame spirit and it is only used
once and is destroyed. In a way, the castle or house is not a
character.

<h2 id="org04bc528">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org04bc528">
<p>
Several other references exist but I hope these points show how this
film made me think of <i>Ghibli</i> tropes and themes. These points do not
belong exclusively to <i>Ghibli</i>, it also can be alluded to <i>Disney</i>.
Even if the film is a hodgepodge of tropes and variations, it is still
a film on its own. I highly recommend watching and supporting this
rare adventure film even if you haven't explored the cinematography of
the great <i>Studio Ghibli</i>.
