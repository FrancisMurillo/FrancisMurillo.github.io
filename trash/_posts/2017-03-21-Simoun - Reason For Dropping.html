<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simoun_%28anime%29">Simoun (2006)</a> has a fascinating setup: <b>gender choice</b>. In a world
where gender is chosen once a person reaches a certain age. If handled
correctly and delicately, a goldmine of material can be harvested and
might make for a classic. After watching three episodes, this show
failed to keep my interest intellectually while compounded by issues
that affect the theme.
</p>

Although I lament dropping it, the ideas it has deserves some
justification or writing.

<h2 id="org4c964c5">Fan Service</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4c964c5">
<p>
The strongest hook is the setup itself that is material for gender
themes. However, the first episode presents us with two girls kissing
without meaningful context. (I know it is a greeting but the screen
focuses on it.)
</p>

</p>

<p>
I don't mind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_service">fan service</a> if it is earned, but this exchange of saliva
is not explained well. This tells me that the show will be bogged down
in making me drool, not think. Rather, fan service in a show about
gender selection is exploiting itself. By focusing on the kiss, it is
viewed as a sexual and possibly arousing act; however, sexual
expressions should not be expressed until the person has made a
choice. <b>Gender does not matter but the expression.</b>
</p>

<p>
I understand there are more nuances as with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell">Ghost in the Shell</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandering_Son">Hourou Musuko</a> where the relationship comes before the sexuality, but
objectifying a gender is contradictory in equal portrayal. To be fair,
this only happened in episode one, but pretending it will not happen
again is foolish. Even then the mechanic of kissing the ship's orb is
suggestive for more things to come.

<h2 id="orgf0fac30">Representation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf0fac30">
<p>
Why is it girls instead of boys? Fan service scenes? From a gender
standpoint, women have the greatest flexibility in expressing
masculine and feminine traits thus have the opportunity on the matter,
thus girls are a natural choice. For this series, the choice of being
a male or female should be equal; however, why is it then that the
environment is female oriented or biased?
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Rather than the architecture, design or inherent bias, <b>where are the
males?</b> What reason is there to be a male if there is no clear
representation? This issue is quickly raised in episode two where the
friend cannot clearly decide.
</p>

</p>

<p>
To its credit, the act of selecting a gender does not end well
indicating some artistic touch; however, the choice should be made
after a few episodes in the series where the genders are established.
Within this world and scene, <b>we do not know what gender roles are in
place</b>. What we know is that she is making the choice to escape the
fight, we couldn't care less what gender she actually takes because
there is no weight or investment in the story or character. Why waste
this pivotal exposition or exploration on a throwaway character?
</p>

<p>
Slowly building the world and characters would make the choice more
meaningful and allow the themes and messages to shine. This is not a
requirement but this is an indicator of the pacing and quality of the
series.

<h2 id="orga42e878">Minor Problems</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga42e878">
<p>
To address the direct quality of the series within three episodes so
far:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><b>Show, don't tell</b></dt><dd>Many scenes can be inferred without dialogue showing the need for
a crutch</dd>
<dt><b>Repetition</b></dt><dd>The exposition keeps repeating itself specially with the
terminology</dd>
<dt><b>Design variation</b></dt><dd>The girls are girly, where is the masculine or unisex designs at
least? Not that it is absent but rather lacking.</dd>
<dt><b>Pampered protagonist</b></dt><dd>Why does she get unfair privileges while the others have to work?</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Primarily, I am concerned with the theme and pacing, I can forgive the
lackluster animation, the weird <i>Simoun</i> craft, the complicated setup
and other elements of the presentation; however, the problems may
persist and ruin the series over time.

<h2 id="org07ecfca">Ideas</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org07ecfca">
<p>
To be fair to the setup, here are some ideas it can explore:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt><b>Gender Roles</b></dt><dd>What does having a gender mean in society?</dd>
<dt><b>Gender Politics</b></dt><dd>Not having a gender equates to power, literally. The war element
adds weight to the choice.</dd>
<dt><b>Relationships and Gender</b></dt><dd>Hinted by <i>Paraietta</i>, the gender only complies with the role of
sexuality. Perhaps, gender is not required to have a
relationship.</dd>
<dt><b>Decision Making</b></dt><dd>If the choice was made for someone else sake and backfired, it
can explore the responsibility of consequences</dd>
<dt><b>Genderless</b></dt><dd>What of people who do not care about gender, what does it mean to
live?</dd>
<dt><b>Adolescence</b></dt><dd>When is gender introduced in their growth if it does not matter
until seventeen?</dd>
<dt><b>Gender Inequality</b></dt><dd>If the world is trying to maintain a balance of men and women
while being biased for women, it can explore inequality more
strongly</dd>
</dl>

<p>
These are just some ideas that a simple thought exploration can yield,
what more if the concept is fully detailed?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9cf4119" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9cf4119">Alternate Setup</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9cf4119">
<p>
To contribute and re-imagine to the setup, <b>I envision robots</b>.
Imagine if sentient artificial intelligence is made by putting a core
or seed intelligence on a robotic shell and letting it experience
humanity. Once the robot has reached a certain age or accumulated
enough data, it must return to a factory to determine what upgrade or
gender it will have. Exact details aside, this variation can avoid fan
service, be less complicated than magic, explore gender in a
genderless frame and more. Sadly, a counter-argument is the notion of
copying software; why waste time when the program can be copied to
another shell.
</p>

<p>
This sounds like <i>Ghost in the Shell</i> but with the focus on the value
of gender. It may or may not be a better idea but it certainly is an
idea.

<h2 id="org4ce586e">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4ce586e">
<p>
Since this is a quick post, I might have omitted some points or failed
to expound on the ideas, but writing more instead of watching is
ironic. I do hope the series turns out good but the indicators are
overwhelming. To summarize, <b>the themes or messages might not be
carried out to its full potential</b> despite having a rich and wonderful
setup. Maybe with another reincarnation will I find hope.
</p>

<p>
Maybe it is just another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_(genre)">yuri</a> series with fan service. If I am indeed
overthinking this, I rather re-watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria-sama_ga_Miteru">Maria-sama ga Miteru</a> to keep my
faith in the genre.
