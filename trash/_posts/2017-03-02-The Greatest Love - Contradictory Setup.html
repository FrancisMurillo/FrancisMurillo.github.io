<h2 id="org2493938">The Greatest Love</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2493938">
<p>
Ironically as a Filipino, I rarely do Philippine movie or series
analysis since it is commonly below passable. As an exercise, I want
to talk about the TV series, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greatest_Love_(Philippine_TV_series)">The Greatest Love</a>. What makes this
standout is that the protagonist is a mother who suffers from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease">Alzheimer's Disease</a> or a memory loss sickness, which is rare and bold.
Before launch, I am both skeptical and supportive for this effort, I
truly want to see more from the Philippine media.
</p>

<p>
The basic goal or story is a single mother of five children must bring
them together as a family. Simply stated but harder done, a broken
family is hard to unify. I won't assume you seen or will see this
series because I don't recommend it. I don't really like criticizing
because I don't enjoy it, I prefer analysis that enhances the viewing
experience that is positive and constructive. As a challenge, the
setup is good enough for me to discuss.
</p>

<p>
The message of the series is that a mother's love is the greatest love
that unifies a broken family. Simple and straightforward. However,
this article is about discussing why the sickness undermines the
message or theme. I won't be spoiling anything as everything is in the
synopsis and trailer.

<h2 id="org8fbdf04">The Mother</h2>

<p>
Based on the trailers, the memory loss gets worse as she tries to
unite her children over dinner. Early on, this is the fundamental
point I want to question, <b>if the mother starts to lose her memory
before she unites the family, does the sickness unite them instead?</b>
My skeptical nature predicts that everyone will pity her and simply be
a passive agent, my supportive nature predicts that she will unite her
family just before she fully loses her memories.
</p>

<p>
To portray love as strong, the character representing it must be
strong herself but not necessarily flawless that the series can use as
material. What we get in the trailer is that she is hiding her
sickness while her mission is not accomplished. By hiding her
sickness, a moment of dramatic revelation will change how she is
treated; we can infer that she is treated poorly or that her situation
is bad for this revelation to make sense. She then is a weak or
passive mother, predicting her portrayal of love as weak and doomed.

<h2 id="org5a7dddf">Agency Loss</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5a7dddf">
<p>
To portray the strength of love, <b>does it need an external conflict
such as a disease?</b> If the series was just the journey of a mother
reuniting her family, that might be a simpler and stronger. Instead,
after the crippling revelation, everyone has to cater to her, instead
of her catering to them. Her agency becomes more passive and sickly
that make her children the active agents. The underlying message
becomes <b>love for the mother, not of the mother</b> is what reunites the
family. By using this element, it undermines the whole message of the
series itself by forcing them to care for her.
</p>

<p>
In the series, the memory loss makes her reveal her secrets, puts her
into dramatic trouble and handicaps her. I have nothing against
Alzheimer's as the series promote awareness; however, it seems to
serve the writers more by prolonging the story, allowing for forgetful
revelations and showing trailers and commercials dramatic conflict. If
the show decides to use pity, the mother must rise above her
condition; however, if we assume she is a weak character, then we can
believe pity is used to bury her dramatically and physically. The
series might show the mother rising above it but it might be too late
or long to truly redeem herself.
</p>

<p>
How strong is the message or theme if the mother was beaten and
required her children to finish her work?  Is she then a valid avatar
of the greatest kind of love? I don't believe so.

<h2 id="org8c07460">Social Media and Memory Preservation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8c07460">
<p>
To expound on this setup, the usual story uses a diary to retain
memories. In this series, the mother (barely) records herself making
video logs. I think using social media here can make it more relevant
in a family context of preserving memory. She can make posts, photos
and videos to preserve her memory on an online database that is not
superficial. It would be fascinating to see a mother, not a teenager,
learn and accept the use of sharing technologies naturally.
</p>

<p>
The series has the reason to explore this aspect with great writing
opportunities. What does it mean to create a family album? What does
it mean to have outings? The nature of the creation and preservation
of memory can tie more closely in the story. Perhaps, it can tie into
how a memories bond the family.
</p>

<p>
This is why I find the setup redeemable despite its flaws. It can
tackle the philosophical topic of memory that is grounded in the
family setting. Not asking for science fiction or artificial
intelligence but a simple and relevant idea can flourish from a story
asking to remember the family and the mother.

<h2 id="org7bab46a">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7bab46a">
<p>
Regardless, the series is bold in portraying a mother as the
foundation of a family but is doomed and flawed by the excessive
memory loss and weak female lead. Maybe advertising, demographics and
marketing affected spoiled this idea? I continue to wait for a well
executed Philippine TV series I can be truly proud of.
