At last! I finally setup an org-mode Jekyll site in GitHub. After creating and deleting a bunch of GitHub repos, mindlessly making my Emacs configuration to an org-file, tackling the package initialization system, checking the source code of org-mode and more; I was able to pinit down.

<p>
Now that I have a blog setup, what to do now? My plan is to make to blog post every week, at least one on a weekend and weekday. What am I going to talk about? Well, random to be precise. Not really but it somewhat is, I will talk about my experiences in developing, coding and whatever the fudge I want. Except the last part, I simply want to share my experiences, maybe it will help mankind or myself.
</p>

<p>
But I still have a long way to go, I have to customize this site from it's base, manage how to use org-mode, learn how to format the post, add some more functionality and so forth. For now, this is a good start.
