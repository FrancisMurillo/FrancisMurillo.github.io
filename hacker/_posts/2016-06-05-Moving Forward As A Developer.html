<p>
Two years and nine months in a company, what have I learned?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Learn to learn
</p>

<p>
Don't expect anyone to teach you, learning to learn is a vital skill
in order to stay relevant and fresh. Once you are on the job, there is
no teacher or syllabus given, you are the teacher and student.
</p>

<p>
It would be nice though if you can learn more formally as a group or
really have a teacher. No book learning can ever teach you experience
learned as from a veteran.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Linux and Bash
</p>

<p>
As a developer, I owe it to myself to use other OS aside from Windows
which I came to grow up with. Diversity and variety is always a
welcome perspective in knowledge and system operation.
</p>

<p>
The benefit I found the most productive about it is working with the
terminal or bash. By being adept with the terminal, you can work with
more flexible and detailed commands that are under your
fingertip. Once I realized how fast to work with the terminal, I
wanted to stay there.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Emacs
</p>

<p>
Not really Emacs, Vi would also do. Learning a powerful text editor,
not an IDE, is an investment in the future. I plan to develop for
probably the rest of my life so I need a life partner who I can make a
contract with.
</p>

<p>
For me, it was Emacs. The versatility and the concept is the selling
point for me, a Lisp interpreter with a text editor. I could have
chosen the focused editor Vi but speed is not my target, customization
is such a sweet word for a tinkerer like me.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Functional Programming
</p>

<p>
As a mathematician and developer, functional programming hit home for
me. During my time, object oriented and state management was a bit
harder to understand in my experience. Thinking in input and output
was way easier than passing messages between ill defined objects.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of my preferences, there are newer ideas and tools I can
learn that it was too good to pass up. Diversity is again welcome if
not exciting.
</p></li>
</ul>


<p>
But technical matters aside, there are more things I can be a better
developer as a person.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Due diligence
</p>

<p>
Good lord knows I have my own mistakes during my stay. I am known to
be careless and have at one time given everyone in the office
administrator privilege due to a Python automation script I got
narcoleptic with. I have ignored overwritten commits and have caused
some backward compatibility breaks.
</p>

<p>
I have been a bit more careful in how I proceed since. This is one
thing I can never learn by myself.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Business architecture
</p>

<p>
Working with a group, I come to realize the inadequacy of
understanding some business rules. Rather how it translates to a
solution sometimes. Whereas adding a column is easy, deciding whether
to add a column is something else entirely.
</p>

<p>
If I am to live longer, I need to connect the rules with the
structure. As a purist mathematician, context might be my weakness
here.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Teaching
</p>

<p>
Not really a big point but when I did my talk at Functional
JavaScript, there is something lacking in how I talk. I am
enthusiastic and I do know what I am talking about, but I have talked
quite a bit too fast.
</p>

<p>
I do enjoy teaching and I do owe my fellow group leaders my share of
preaching but I wonder if I really did my job. Sharing the knowledge
is sharing the love.
</p></li>
</ul>


<p>
Regardless of faults or gifts, there is one thing I do want to stress is
one thing that is harder to control. Environment.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Being the worst in a group
</p>

<p>
If you are one of the best in the group, then you might want to
consider looking for a group where you are the worst. Being the
weakest in the chain keeps me on my toes. Being the greenhorn had
forced to learn as much without disappointing my peers, some healthy
social pressure here.
</p>

<p>
If you are one of the best without really doing anything, then the
group might not teach you anything else if you are not in a leadership
position. I lament this on reading Douglas Crockford's JavaScript The
Good Parts does not make you a master. That itself is a little sad.
</p>

<p>
I want to be in a group where I can learn more but of course you can't
really choose who you're with sometimes but the group can bring you up
or down to their level.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Poor management
</p>

<p>
Whatever good hopes you have, a poor project management is obviously
going to derail you have. Even if I want to teach Emacs or Functional
JavaScript, the company or project may not support it despite being a
labor of love and good will to others.
</p>

<p>
The focus within a poorly managed project is just the project which is
sad for everyone. I find the journey more important than the end goal.
</p></li>
</ul>


<p>
There are more things to hinder a developer but the environment is a bit
harder to control or manage itself. At the end of it all, if the
environment is not suitable for growth; change it and that may mean
changing places which is hard in itself. Sometimes moving on is better
in the long run. Do I want to do the same things over and over again
even if I get paid more? Perhaps but if it doesn't grant me a sense of
happiness or purpose then I need to travel the world. Diversity and agency.
</p>

<p>
At the end of ten years, have I become an international coder? At the
end of ten years, have I mastered Emacs? At the end, have I done all
that I can? Only time.
