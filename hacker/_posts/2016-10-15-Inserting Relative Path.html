I was working on a <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">react native</a> application and I needed to insert the
relative path of an import statement based on the current file/buffer.
Since this involves files, I immediately checked <a href="https://github.com/rejeep/f.el">f.el</a> for any function
that would immediately get the relative path from a file to a file.
The closest I got and was <a href="https://github.com/rejeep/f.el#f-relative-path-optional-dir">f-relative</a> but it wasn't cutting it, it was
giving me a file relative to a directory. After an hour or two of
finding which function it is, I decided to just write it myself.
</p>

<p>
So write it I did and in such poor time, it took me another hour or
two to get it done for whatever reason I could not comprehend. Once I
did that, it was a simple matter to write the commands to get what I
wanted.

Here is a link of the <a href="https://gist.github.com/FrancisMurillo/02a1c638e9d32b5d8a60e9aa1ad9aa50">code</a> for the curious. I hope the screencast is
helpful as it is my first and won't be my last. I hope I can make more
simpler posts showing something done in Emacs, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Malabarba/camcorder.el/">camcorder.el</a>.

At first I thought it would be easy to implement by finding their
common parent, determining the relative paths of the source and target
path by <code>f-relative</code>, converting the relative source path into <code>..</code>
and just appending the relative target path with the path separator.
Some things aren't just that easy.
</p>

<p>
But the use of <code>f-relative</code> and <code>f-join</code> did not return consistent
outputs that I expected. So out of frustration, I just decided to find
the common parent instead and thankfully <code>f-split</code> is one thing I can
rely on.
</p>

<p>
By converting the source and target paths into lists and dropping the
head until it wasn't equal, I thought I nailed it but apparently that
wasn't enough. I realized after chopping the list of until there was
no common parent, it didn't handle the case of neighboring files
properly. What I needed was the last common parent which I dropped. As
hard as I thought about it, I needed a recursive function maintaining
that singular value which is helpful in both cases where either source
or parent node is a parent of one another. I really hoped I didn't
have to use a <code>cond</code> and recursion but I had to and it pains me to do
so. Sometimes I just have to bite the bullet.
</p>

<p>
One small thing also tripped me up is the use of <code>find-file-read-args</code>
where I needed a <code>find-file</code> interface without going to the file. You
could argue I could use <code>find-file-noselect</code> but I didn't want to open
the file at all. I just needed the file path, I didn't have to open
it. It took me some time to find the function and the hazard that it
returns a pair instead of just the filename. The bigger concern
here is that I might have used a private function and maybe I should
have just read the manual. Oh well.w
